And servant leadership&#x2014;the idea that managing with respect, honesty, love, and spirituality empowers employees&#x2014;helps individuals answer that calling. Bestselling author and former Fortune 500 executive James A. Autry reveals the servant leader&#x2019;s tools, a set of skills and ideals that will transform the way business is done.

Ultimately, Autry explores how it can be a valuable, refreshing, and rewarding approach to leading others in business life.</p><p>"<b>This is an awesome book</b>.

Well, one thing is for sure, he&#39;ll have to be creative. Like, if you want to keep your heart from breaking, just make sure it&#39;s well padded and protected by tying a pillow around your chest. Want to keep your hands attached? Simple-stick them on with gloves and lots of glue. Just be careful not to laugh your head off!</p><p><b>Tedd Arnold</b>&nbsp; is the author of such children's classics as&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>No Jumping on the Bed!</i> and <i>No More Water in the Tub!</i> He has published more than 50 books as author and illustrator. He has received&nbsp; The Theodor Seuss Geisel Honor&nbsp;for <i>I Spy Fly Guy </i>and has won&nbsp;The&nbsp;Edgar Award for his Young Adult Novel, <i>Rat Life.</i>Gr 1-4-Through zany, brightly colored illustrations and rhyming verse, Arnold explores common figures of speech that amaze and frighten a young boy. "I'll bet that broke your heart," "give him a hand," "Hold your tongue," and "jumps out of his skin" are only a few of the sayings that worry the protagonist, whose imaginings are energetically depicted in colored-pencil and watercolor washes. Goofy, cartoonlike artwork explores the deepest recesses of the child's overwrought and overworked imagination. Kids will love faces cracking, lungs being coughed up, and bodies flying apart. Vivid color and a robust artistic style will attract younger children who may not get the joke, but older children and parents will. Singsong verses in hand-lettered text strain to rhyme in some instances, with a forced, uneven gait. Although the boy's parents reassure him, the story ends where it begins. The father, who "didn't mean to be unkind," tells the child that they were afraid that he'd lost his mind. The final drawing has the boy's brain falling out of his head and onto the floor. This story is like a wild and crazy, totally manic Amelia Bedelia. Children will ask for it again and again.<p></p><p><i>Alice Casey Smith, Sayreville Public Schools, Parlin, NJ</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Quick Flip Questions for Critical Thinking</h2><p>Paperback.

That&#39;s no problem for Olivia, of course, because she knows how to do everything. From lion taming to trampoline jumping, unicycling to tight-rope walking, Olivia is the ultimate performer--with the ultimate imagination. Now in a board book edition perfect for little hands, readers will delight to see how Ringmaster Olivia learns to fly!</p><p>When it comes time to tell the class what she did on her vacation, Olivia isn't at all nervous. In fact, she remembers it quite clearly--she went to the circus, you see. "But when we got there, all the circus people were out sick with ear infections." What are the odds? But the show must go on! Fortunately, Olivia jumps right in to help out--riding elephants, posing as the Tattooed Lady (she draws on the pictures with a marker), taming lions, walking tightropes, juggling, clowning around, and more. In a marvelous fold-out, four-panel spread, our porcine heroine even reigns supreme as the Queen of the Trampoline. "And that's how I saved the circus. And now I am famous." Olivia looks proud. Her teacher looks mad. Ian Falconer shines in this dryly hilarious sequel to his 2001 Caldecott Honor Book <i>Olivia</i>.

The illustrations were wonderful. The story was engaging. And the animals were adorable! Out of all the animals on the farm, Wobble, has finally been invited to Thanksgiving dinner and he couldn't be more excited! He spends all week preparing for the big day. Pruning his feathers, eating his vegetables, practicing his singing... He's going to be the perfect dinner quest. The other barn animals seem a little concerned but Wobble is ready for the big day. I loved the ending of the story and the recipes at the end. This book is a definite must have for anyone who celebrates Thanksgiving!<br></p> --Sydney Powell, Amazon Customer<br><br><p><b><strong>What a Great Surprise!&nbsp;</strong></b></p><p>Wow! Way to write an inspiring, beautiful story teaching us to care for animals, Becky! The happiness the turkey felt and the concern of his friends led to a wonderful surprise. I don't want to spoil this for others, of course, and I urge parents, teachers and all to enjoy this new book of Becky's. It is rich, fun and a sweet, sweet story that's awesomely illustrated by Zuzana Svobodova.<br></p> --Joy Resor, author<br><br><p><b><strong></strong><strong>A Wonderful New Thanksgiving Story!</strong><br></b></p><p>Becky Cumming delivers a great new story about Thanksgiving in "Gobble Gobble Mr. Wobble." The story follows the excitement of Mr. Wobble the Turkey as he receives an invitation to have Thanksgiving dinner with Farmer Joe and his family. Cumming's provides a great twist that a Turkey is having dinner with a family instead of being the dinner. This story does a great job highlighting that Thanksgiving can have more options rather than turkey and animals in general for people that have different dietary lifestyles. Cummings also provides some great Thanksgiving recipes for vegetarians at the end of the book. Zuzana Svobodova once again does an outstanding job with the story illustrations. I recommend this story for children of all ages.<br></p> --Jack Purser, Amazon Customer</p><h2>Beatrice Zinker, Upside Down Thinker (Beatrice Zinker, Upside Down Thinker, 1)</h2><p><p>Beatrice does her best thinking upside down.</p> <p>Hanging from trees by her knees, doing handstands . . . for Beatrice Zinker, upside down works every time. She was definitely upside down when she and her best friend, Lenny, agreed to wear matching ninja suits on the first day of third grade. But when Beatrice shows up at school dressed in black, Lenny arrives with a cool new outfit and a cool new friend. Even worse, she seems to have forgotten all about the top-secret operation they planned!</p> <p>Can Beatrice use her topsy-turvy way of thinking to save the mission, mend their friendship, and flip things sunny-side up?</p></p><p><strong>Shelley Johannes</strong> previously spent ten years in architecture, where she fell in love with felt-tip pens, tracing paper, and the greatness of black turtlenecks.

Find her online at shelleyjohannes.com.Gr 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;In the tradition of Ramona Quimby and Clementine, this chapter book series debut tells the story of a young girl dealing with the problems of friendship, family, and school. Beatrice Zinker is an unusual girl; she does all her best thinking while hanging upside down. She and her friend Lenny agree to wear ninja suits on the first day of third grade. But during the summer, something changed. Lenny came back from vacation with a new best friend&#x2014;and she isn't wearing her ninja suit. Beatrice is devastated and has to come up with an idea to rebuild the friendship before it is lost forever. While there are many titles that feature realistic stories about young characters dealing with the problems of friendship and family, Beatrice stands tall among her contemporaries.

The British now occupy the city, and redcoat guards are everywhere! While the boys are being held captive by a den of Patriot spies, the girls have been taken in by a wealthy Tory family.<br><br>The pox is rampant; danger lies around every corner--and there's no hope for returning home to their own time. How will these seven children survive?<br><br>Readers will relish the nonstop action and humorous dialogue in this riveting sequel to Woodruff's bestselling novel, GEORGE WASHINGTON'S SOCKS.</p><p>The bestselling author of GEORGE WASHINGTON&#39;S SOCKS and THE RAVENMASTER&#39;S SECRET, Woodruff has written more than twenty books for children, including picture books, historical fiction, and lighthearted fantasy. Her numerous school visits each year are popular with kids and teachers. The sequel to GEORGE WASHINGTON&#39;S SOCKS, GEORGE WASHINGTON&#39;S SPY, will be published in November 2010. She lives with her family in Martin&#39;s Creek, Pennsylvania.Gr 4-6&#x2013;In this sequel to George Washington's Socks (Scholastic, 1991), the members of the Adventure Club are again transported by rowboat back in time to the American Revolution where 10-year-old Matt and the other boys get caught up in a Patriot spy ring while his younger sister and her friends are rescued by a Loyalist family. The boys are immediately sympathetic to the Patriot cause and agree to help deliver a message concerning the Battle of Dorchester, which they also happen to be learning about in school at the beginning of the story. The girls, on the other hand, are horrified to be staying with &#x201c;the enemy,&#x201d; but who is right and who is wrong becomes more complex as the story unfolds. The kids witness the Patriots doing terrible things to the Loyalists and realize that the Torys have reasons for staying loyal to England. Woodruff does an excellent job of conveying the complexities of war, particularly one that pits family against family in a very real way. This is a great introduction to the Revolutionary period, brought to life with historical figures and conflicts through the eyes of today's kids. It also effectively humanizes those who were loyal to England. Alternating between the two sides, the story is fast paced, exciting, and informative.&#x2013;Kerry Roeder, The Brearley School, New York City. (c) Copyright 2010.

The adventure begins as readers decide how they will travel: as a passenger, a crew member, or a stowaway. The excitement continues as they complete "quick challenges," which require readers to cut, draw, decode, and much more. Each activity leads to more choices and new destinations entwined in the real history of the Titanic. Even the most reluctant of readers is likely to be pulled into this gamelike book as they are enticed to draw and personalize the story. In a school library setting, though, this may prove problematic, as the book cannot be reused once a reader engages in the drawing and cutting activities. VERDICT A truly engaging format for historical adventurers of all ages.

Now the inspiration for a new Christmas special, <i>CLICK, CLACK, MOO: Christmas on the Farm</i>.</b><br><br>Farmer Brown has a problem. His cows like to type. All day long he hears:<br> <br><i>Click, clack, moo.</i><br> <i>Click, clack, moo.</i><br> <i>Click, clack, moo.</i><br> <br>But Farmer Brown's problems REALLY begin when his cows start leaving him notes...Come join the fun as a bunch of literate cows turn Farmer Brown's farm upside-down! This package includes a paperback book along with a CD of country music star Randy Travis reading this <i>New York Times</i> bestseller!</p><p>The literacy rate in Farmer Brown's barn goes up considerably once his cows find an old typewriter and begin typing. To the harassed farmer's dismay, his communicative cows quickly become contentious:<p> </p><blockquote> Dear Farmer Brown,<br> The barn is very cold at night. We'd like some electric blankets.<br> Sincerely,<br> The Cows </blockquote><p> When he refuses to comply with their demands, the cows take action. Farmer Brown finds another note on the barn door: "Sorry. We're closed. No milk today." Soon the striking cows and Farmer Brown are forced to reach a mutually agreeable compromise, with the help of an impartial party--the duck. But this poor, beleaguered farmer's "atypical" troubles are not over yet!</p><p> This hilarious tale will give young rebels-in-the-making a taste of the power of peaceful protest and the satisfaction of cooperative give and take.

Many Python developers are now taking an interest in high-level software architecture patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn&#x2019;t always straightforward.</p><p>With this practical guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity. Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in idiomatic Python that explain how to avoid some of the unnecessary verbosity of Java and C# syntax. You&#x2019;ll learn how to implement each of these patterns in a Pythonic way.</p><p>Architectural design patterns include:</p><ul><li>Dependency inversion, and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture)</li><li>Domain-driven design&#x2019;s distinction between entities, value objects, and aggregates</li><li>Repository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storage</li><li>Events, commands, and the message bus</li><li>Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)</li><li>Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices</li></ul></p><p><p>After an idyllic childhood spent playing with BASIC on French 8-bit computers like the Thomson T-07 whose keys go "boop" when you press them, Harry Percival spent a few years being deeply unhappy as a management consultant. Soon he rediscovered his true geek nature, and was lucky enough to fall in with a bunch of XP fanatics, working on the pioneering but sadly defunct Resolver One spreadsheet. He worked at PythonAnywhere LLP, spreading the gospel of TDD world-wide at talks, workshops and conferences. He is now with MADE.COM.</p><p>Bob Gregory is a UK-based software architect with MADE.COM.

Her work has won more than fifty child-voted state awards.&nbsp; An avid reader, traveler, and all-around arts lover, Ms. Hahn lives in Columbia, Maryland.&nbsp;Visit her online at www.marydowninghahnbooks.com.</p>Staying with Great-Aunt Blythe in the ancestral home while his parents are on a dig, ``Drew''--so called because his great- grandfather Edward abhors his full name--is immediately aware of a presence in the attic. It's another boy, also named Andrew, also 12, and identical to Drew in appearance, though not in character. The gently reared Drew is timid; Andrew's a prankster and a daredevil, as Drew finds after Andrew persuades him to trade places so that Andrew's diptheria can be cured by modern medicine. Drew finds himself in 1910, where he faces an adoring younger brother's disgust at his sudden wimpiness, observes tomboyish older sister Hannah's romance, scraps with obnoxious Cousin Edward, and gets routine (though not vicious) punishments with Andrew's father's belt. Meanwhile, Andrew's life is saved, but--not sure he wants to switch back--he suggests a contest with the marbles he's hidden in the attic where the boys met. Hannah, who taught Andrew his skill, now helps Drew to win so that he can return to his own time. Like Pearce's Tom's Midnight Garden, the pleasurably atmospheric story ends with Drew's reunion with now elderly people from the past; the Missouri setting and neatly crafted, accessible plot make this a fine bridge to that British classic. Meanwhile, the sampling of past mores is as entertaining as it is instructive, and each boy's well-drawn character is believably enriched by emulating the other to preserve his disguise. Another solid and enjoyable performance from this popular, award-winning author. (Fiction. 8-12) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Stricken with both awe and fear, he began to shake, fell to his knees, and prayed. Ever since, people from all over the world have come to explore Niagara: among them the daredevils determined to tumble down or walk across the falls on tightrope. Kids will get a kick reading about the hare-brained stunts and will also learn how the falls were formed and how--one day--they will disappear.</p><p>Megan Stine has written several books for young readers, including Where Is the White House?, Who Was Marie Curie?, Who Was Ulysses S. Grant?, Who Is Michelle Obama?, and Who Was Sally Ride?Where Is Niagara Falls?<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a beautiful, hot summer afternoon in 1960. Seven-year-old Roger Woodward was excited. He and his older sister Deanne were about to go on a boat ride. It was Roger&#x2019;s first time ever in a boat. They were going out onto the Niagara River in a motorboat that was just big enough to hold three people. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Remember to wear your life jacket,&#x201d; Roger&#x2019;s father called out to him. His father knew they needed to be careful. They were going on a river that led to the biggest, most awesome waterfall in America.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man who owned the boat was a family friend named Jim Honeycutt. Jim was a strong swimmer and lifeguard. He knew all about how to stay safe on the river. He made sure Roger kept his life jacket on.<br> &nbsp;<br> As they passed under a bridge, Roger asked if he could steer the boat. It was a bad idea to let Roger steer right then. The boat was nearing a dangerous part of the river. Most boaters knew to turn around there. The river was full of rocks and rapids that led to the edge of Niagara Falls.<br> &nbsp;<br> But for some reason, Jim said yes. <br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly, the boat hit something hard under the water. The engine screamed. A piece of the motor was broken. They couldn&#x2019;t drive the boat away from the rocks. The rapids were pulling them toward the edge!<br> &nbsp;<br> Jim grabbed some oars and began to row as hard as he could. He shouted to Deanne to put on the only other life jacket in the boat. Powerful waves tossed them up and down. When a huge one hit the boat, all three were thrown into the swirling, raging rapids.<br> &nbsp;<br> Roger tried to hold on to Jim, but the water ripped him away.<br> &nbsp;<br> People on the shore saw what was happening. They ran up and down, but no one could figure out a way to help. <br> &nbsp;<br> Roger felt himself being bounced against rocks. Then he was dragged over the edge of the gigantic falls, like a fly being flushed down a toilet.<br> &nbsp;<br> No one had ever survived going over Niagara Falls without something&#x2014;a boat or a barrel&#x2014;to protect them.<br> &nbsp;<br> But somehow, a miracle happened! Roger found himself floating in the water below the falls. A tourist boat happened to be nearby. Someone spotted Roger&#x2019;s red life jacket and fished him out of the water. He was saved! <br> &nbsp;<br> Roger became famous that day. He was the first person ever to survive going over Niagara Falls without protection. When he grew up, he became a sailor. He loved the water and even joined the navy. His sister survived that day, too. She was pulled out of the river before ever reaching the falls. <br> &nbsp;<br> But Jim Honeycutt died in the terrible accident. Sadly, he was not the first&#x2014;or last&#x2014;to lose his life to the biggest, most awesome, and most dangerous waterfall in America.</p><h2>Eric Carle&#39;s Very Little Library: Very Lonely Firefly/Very Busy Spider/Very Hungry Caterpillar</h2><p>Board-book versions of Eric Carle's best-known story <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar </i>and<i> </i>the much-loved classics<i> The Very Busy Spider</i> and <i>The Very Quiet Cricket</i> are packaged together in this colourful must-have slipcase.

Depending on where you live, you might be able to find a coven or circle where you can meet fellow Wiccans and ask questions, but most newcomers to Wicca find themselves traveling solo.<br><br>Luckily, there is no shortage of information about the &#x201c;Old Religion&#x201d; in print and online. Yet with all of the diverse and often conflicting perspectives out there, it can be hard to know where to begin. That&#x2019;s why best-selling author Lisa Chamberlain created the <i>Wicca Starter Kit</i>, bringing together three of her most popular guides&#x2014;Wicca for Beginners, Finding Your Path, and Living a Magical Life&#x2014;to get your journey underway.<br><br><p><b>Wicca for Beginners: a Guide to Wiccan Beliefs, Rituals, Magic, and Witchcraft</b></p><i>Wicca for Beginners</i> was created as an entry point for anyone seeking information about this fascinating religion.

Perhaps you want to join a coven within an established tradition, or maybe a more individualized practice is your calling. In <i>Finding Your Path</i>, you&#x2019;ll learn about the wide spectrum of contemporary Wiccan practice, from traditional &#x201c;orthodox&#x201d; covens to looser, more &#x201c;eclectic&#x201d; covens and circles, as well as the more recent phenomenon of solitary practice, which has appeal for both traditional and eclectic Wiccans alike.<br><br>Lisa covers everything you need to know about covens and circles, including their history, their structures, and how to find your Wiccan community.

Follow&nbsp;@hbryant42<p>&nbsp;</p><p>This might come as a total shock, but when I was a kid, my favorite thing about playing football was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fear.</p><p>In a lot of ways, I loved being afraid. My friends and I used to play football, or when we had too many kids for that, a game called &#x201c;pig pile,&#x201d; where one person carried the football and all the other players chased and tried to tackle him. When he was finally brought to the ground, he would toss the ball up in the air and some other brave soul would pick it up and run for as long as possible before <i>he</i> was tackled.</p><p>When I was the one being chased, every second was filled with the fear of being taken down hard to the ground.</p><p>But here&#x2019;s the part that made being afraid fun. Are you ready? It was laughing at the fear!</p><p>I know that might seem odd, so let me explain: We all know the goal of football is to score touchdowns and prevent the other team from scoring. Defenses love trying to intimidate offenses. I played running back, wide receiver, and even quarterback sometimes. I remember how big some of the other kids were. I remember how they would stand on the other side of the line and try to scare me.</p><p><i>You are a dead man if you touch that ball. I&#x2019;m gonna squash you like a bug&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>The quarterback would hand me the ball and I would see the defense race toward me, charging and snarling. Here they came, trying to make good on their promises to indeed squash me like a bug, and the fear would kick in.</p><p>So I ran.</p><p>And I dodged.</p><p>And I spun.</p><p>And I realized that I was <i>fast</i>! I would score a touchdown and the guys who told me I was a dead man would get mad because not only was I very much alive, but my team was winning and theirs was losing!</p><p>So yeah, big kids were stronger than me, but I was faster. Even so, sometimes I got hit, and they would smile and talk trash while I was down (<i>Who&#x2019;s smiling now?</i>), but I always got up. What started as an exercise in fear turned into a little game of me betting that I could be faster than everyone. And, when necessary, proving I could take a hit and still get back up.</p><p>These were the challenges of football. Speed against strength. Fear against courage. I loved it all. And it was just as much fun to watch on TV as it was to play, for so many reasons.</p><p>I loved the NFL uniforms, particularly the helmets. I grew up in Boston and the original Patriots logo was the hardest logo in sports to draw. Believe me&#x2014;I tried a lot.</p><p>Most of all, I loved the competition, the way the Steelers, Dolphins, Raiders, Vikings, and Cowboys ruled the game and always seemed to end up having to beat each other to get to the Super Bowl. My childhood team, the Patriots, could never beat those other guys, but I rooted for them just the same.</p><p>I rooted for players because I loved how they moved, how the really fast guys would just break away from defenders after a long reception, reach the end zone, and dance in celebration. The Dallas Cowboys became my adoptive team because I loved the great quarterback Roger Staubach and running back Tony Dorsett. Later, I couldn&#x2019;t help but admire the historic San Francisco 49ers dynasty of the 1980s, the way their innovative offense and always-cool quarterback Joe Montana seemed unstoppable whenever a game was on the line.</p><p>The game has continued to change over the years. When I was a kid, I used to come home from playing football with my shirt ripped and my clothing covered in dirt and grass stains. My friends and I played tackle with no helmets, and even if you banged heads with another kid, people just told us to &#x201c;shake it off.&#x201d; Today we know that the players are so strong that getting hit and tackled that many times hurts not just the body but the brain. There is no such thing as a minor injury to the brain. Because we understand more about these injury risks, because the game is potentially so dangerous, many parents no longer let their kids play football the way I used to. So while I still enjoy watching the game on TV, more than anything these days I hope that the skilled people playing it remain safe.</p><p>Other shifts in attitude have taken place, as well. Some of the sport&#x2019;s traditions are no longer acceptable in today&#x2019;s society. For example, even though &#x201c;Redskins&#x201d; is still the nickname of the Washington football team, I do not use that word in this book because I consider it to be offensive to all people of Native American descent, as well as demeaning to the people using the term. Throughout the book, therefore, I refer to the team as &#x201c;Washington.&#x201d;</p><p>This is a book not only of football legends&#x2014;but of the legend of pro football. It is this country&#x2019;s most popular sport. While the game has been played since the late 1800s, for the sake of this book we begin when two rival leagues, the National Football League and the American Football League, became one in 1970. The only exception to this rule can be found in the Timeline of Football&#x2019;s Key Moments at the end of the book, which includes older events that were too important to leave out. Above all else, though, this book is a tribute to the Super Bowl, which began as a little-watched championship between the two leagues in 1967, only to evolve into the most popular sporting event in America. And it continues to evolve&#x2014;2016 marks the first Super Bowl that will be numbered with Arabic numerals (i.e. &#x201c;Super Bowl 50&#x201d;) instead of Roman numerals (&#x201c;Super Bowl L&#x201d;), which have been in use since the first Super Bowl.</p><p>Through the lens of the Super Bowl, this book is about the rise of dynasties and the fall of giants. If the book had been written thirty years ago, for instance, the Miami Dolphins would&#x2019;ve been a really big part of it and the Patriots wouldn&#x2019;t have been mentioned at all, because back then Miami was so good&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the Patriots? The Patriots were gum on the bottom of your shoe, stepped on by everyone.</p><p>Times change, and now the Patriots are one of the great franchises in history. Miami, meanwhile, hasn&#x2019;t been to a Super Bowl since 1984 and hasn&#x2019;t won one since 1973.</p><p>In the NFL, it&#x2019;s all about the Super Bowl.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>SUPER BOWL I</p><p><br>A NEW DAY</p><p>GREEN BAY PACKERS VS. KANSAS CITY CHIEFS</p><p>There was nothing super about Super Bowl I. The biggest game of the year wasn&#x2019;t even called the Super Bowl at first. That would come later. Before there was the National Football League as we know it today, two leagues coexisted, sometimes in the same city, and they didn&#x2019;t like each other. The first was the National Football League, founded in 1920 and&#x2014;save for a brief rival league called the AAFC in the 1940s that created the Baltimore Colts, San Francisco 49ers, and Cleveland Browns&#x2014;they went unchallenged as the only professional football league in America for forty years.</p><p>The second was the American Football League, founded in 1960 as a challenger to the NFL. It brought the sport to cities like Boston, Kansas City, Denver, and Houston that did not have pro football teams in the National Football League.</p><p>Football off the field in the 1960s was dominated by the AFL-NFL rivalry. The NFL laughed at the new league, because surely it was inferior to the great teams of the NFL. But over the next few years, the AFL gained credibility and popularity, and soon enough, the heads of the two leagues began to discuss the idea of a merger.</p><p>They came to an agreement in 1966, keeping their regular season schedules separate for four years, but bound together by a championship game&#x2014;a face-off between the AFL champion and NFL champion. The championship game would be called the &#x201c;AFL-NFL World Championship Game,&#x201d; and the inaugural game was played in Los Angeles, on January 15, 1967, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.</p><p>The Green Bay Packers were the dominant team in the NFL during the 1960s. There were other strong teams, such as the Cleveland Browns, led by the great running back Jim Brown, and the Baltimore Colts, led by legendary quarterback Johnny Unitas, but the Packers always seemed to end the season on top.</p><p>The leader of the pack was the legendary coach Vince Lombardi, who relied on his outstanding play-caller, hall-of-fame quarterback Bart Starr. Max McGee, a terrific receiver, was Starr&#x2019;s go-to wideout. In the backfield, Green Bay had not one, but two great running backs: the physical fullback Jim Taylor and the versatile halfback Paul Hornung.</p><p>Defensively, the Packers were just as stacked, with a dangerous defensive line led by Forrest Gregg, a fearsome middle linebacker in Ray Nitschke, and an unforgiving secondary that featured cornerback Herb Adderley and safety Willie Wood.</p><p>The Packers had won the NFL championship in 1961, 1962, and 1965, and they entered the first year of the Super Bowl as heavy favorites to represent the National Football League.</p><p>Today, as you know, NFL teams throw the football a lot. Peyton Manning drops back to pass and has three, four, and sometimes five receivers to look for. Tom Brady will drop back into the &#x201c;shotgun&#x201d; formation, 5 yards behind the center, to get a better look at the defense and buy some time before they reach him.</p><p>In the 1960s, Lombardi&#x2019;s Packers were a power running team that mixed in some passing elements. The 1966 team was nearly last in the league in passing attempts, which upset Starr, who wanted to throw the ball&#x2014;as all quarterbacks do. They were famous for the &#x201c;Packer Sweep,&#x201d; during which Starr would snap the ball and the offensive line would block to the left while Taylor or Hornung or their newest back, Elijah Pitts, ran behind. The skilled line would create a human wall for the running backs, engulfing the defense in a show of sheer power. By the fourth quarter, with defenses beat up and tired from an afternoon of being pounded by the Packers line, Lombardi, a relentless foe, would continue to run the ball, leaving defenses gasping for air and eventually surrendering large chunks of yardage. It was a strategy that worked time and time again.</p><p>NFL seasons were fourteen games long in these days, not sixteen, like we have today. The Packers went 12-2 in 1966, including one dominant stretch in which they crushed the Bears (17&#x2013;0), the Falcons (56&#x2013;3) and the Lions (31&#x2013;7)&#x2014;a combined score of 104&#x2013;10!</p><p>The year of the first Championship Game, the Packers played Dallas in the NFL title game. The Cowboys were founded in 1960 and in a very short time, under the guidance of another legendary coach, Tom Landry, made a fast rise to prominence. Landry was a defensive coach. He and Lombardi had coached together in the 1950s with the New York Giants. Landry had been the defensive coordinator, and Lombardi the offensive coach, but Landry&#x2019;s Cowboys were a high-scoring, high-offense team, scoring 30 points or more in half of their games&#x2014;and twice reaching 50! They had a flamboyant quarterback in &#x201c;Dandy&#x201d; Don Meredith, and perhaps the fastest man in football, wide receiver &#x201c;Bullet&#x201d; Bob Hayes, who was so fast, he was once a sprinter in the Olympics.</p><p>So it was the ground-and-pound attack of Lombardi and the defending champion Packers against the high-flying attack of Landry&#x2019;s upstart Cowboys. The genius of Lombardi, though, wasn&#x2019;t just his passion to win, but his ability to find weaknesses in an opponent and beat them at their own game. So when the Packers played the Cowboys in the title game, they didn&#x2019;t rely on running the football, like they usually did. Instead, they changed up their strategy, passing the ball the way Dallas had all season. Starr, so often frustrated that Lombardi never seemed to let him throw the ball, threw 4 touchdowns.</p><p>The Packers ended up beating the Cowboys 34&#x2013;27. At 13-2, they were headed to the first-ever Super Bowl. Their opponents? The AFL&#x2019;s Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p>Coincidentally, the Chiefs began life in Dallas as the Dallas Texans. They had won the AFL title in 1962 and then moved to Kansas City. Their quarterback, Len Dawson, had been a career backup in the NFL when he jumped leagues and joined the Texans in 1962, giving him a second chance to be a pro starter. In the AFL, Dawson showed he was an accurate passer and team leader. He was arguably the best quarterback in the AFL, which was proof to some that he only needed to be given a chance to succeed. To others, though, Dawson being the best quarterback only showed that the AFL was a weak league. Naturally, in Super Bowl I, Dawson had something to prove.</p><p>The Chiefs running back, Mike Garrett, a Heisman Trophy&#x2013;winning star during his time at the University of Southern California, had said no to an invitation to join the NFL, boldly choosing to play in the AFL instead. Together with Dawson and talented wide receiver Otis Taylor, the Chiefs were an offensive machine. They averaged more than 30 points per game, and their 448 total points were 90 points more than Buffalo&#x2019;s, the next closest team. The Chiefs could score on the ground or in the air, but it was the arm of Dawson that powered them.</p><p>They went through the regular season untroubled, and faced Buffalo in the AFL title game. The Bills sacked Dawson 9 times, yet the Chiefs still crushed them 31&#x2013;7, making them the first AFL representatives in the inaugural Super Bowl.</p><p>The announced crowd at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was 61,946, which wasn&#x2019;t even a sellout. Today, Katy Perry or Beyonc� headline the halftime show. For this game, the University of Michigan and University of Arizona marching bands provided the entertainment.</p><p>Today, a thirty-second television commercial costs nearly $2.5 million. In 1967, the cost was $42,000. The game was televised on both NBC and CBS. Today, cable and broadcast channels pay billions of dollars to take turns televising the event.</p><p>After a tightly-fought first quarter at 7&#x2013;7, the Packers took a 14&#x2013;10 lead before halftime and never looked back. The Chiefs wouldn&#x2019;t score again for the rest of the game. As much as the AFL desperately wanted to win, to show the NFL that they belonged on the same field as the NFL&#x2019;s best, the Packers overwhelmed them, 35&#x2013;10.</p><p>Green Bay would continue to be the dominant team next season, again representing the NFL in the second AFL-NFL World Championship Game. Super Bowl II was barely more competitive than the first one, as the Packers destroyed the Oakland Raiders 33&#x2013;14 and solidified themselves as the team of the 1960s with five championships, and Lombardi as one of the great coaches of all time. The dynasty would end there, however, as the Packers would not reach another championship for nearly thirty years. Lombardi&#x2019;s Packers, though, never fully faded into memory. They were so great, and Lombardi&#x2019;s influence so powerful, that the trophy would later be renamed the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The championship trophy retains that name to this day.</p><p>The game was a dud, but it had a new nickname, the kind that stuck: The AFL-NFL World Championship was dead. The Super Bowl was born.</p><p>TOP TEN LIST</p><p><i>M</i>ore than any other sport, football is where coaching makes the biggest difference.

Decked out in Halloween costumes, four little friends venture down the street to "the witch's house," deliciously scared by other young trick-or-treaters along the way. When they arrive at their destination, they hear a screech and see the witch herself. Evidently a friendly little witch (and probably a costumed classmate), she ushers them into her home for a Halloween party. Former kindergarten teacher Mr. Krieb shows that he knows a thing or two about holding children's attention in this rhyming, rhythmic text with call-and-response sections. With a multiracial cast of characters, Alley's child-friendly drawings glow with watercolor washes and brim with details that expand the narrative and add to the fun. Both verse and pictures will appeal to young children who like to be reassured as well as scared at Halloween. A good seasonal choice for reading at home or in the classroom. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

They both like shooting marbles, they both want to be firemen, and they both love to swim. But there's one important way they're different: Joe is white and John Henry is black, and in the South in 1964, that means John Henry isn't allowed to do everything his best friend is. Then a law is passed that forbids segregation and opens the town pool to everyone. Joe and John Henry are so excited they race each other there...only to discover that it takes more than a new law to change people's hearts.</p><p>Deborah Wiles was born in Alabama and grew up in an Air Force family, moving many times but digging deep roots into the Mississippi soil of her extended family. She still travels &#x201c;down South&#x201d; today from her longtime home in Frederick, Maryland, where she lives with her family and works as a freelance writer. She also teaches writing and oral history workshops&#x2014;sharing with children how all history is really biography, and how every person&#x2019;s story is important. <i>Freedom Summer</i> is her first book.<br><br>Jerome Lagarrigue was born and grew up in Paris, France, in a family of artists. Mr. Lagarrigue is the illustrator of <i>Freedom Summer </i>as well as <i>My Man Blue</i> by Nikki Grimes, and his work has also appeared in the <i>New Yorker</i> and on the cover of the <i>New York Times Book Review.</i> A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, he teaches drawing and painting at Parsons School of Design and lives in Brooklyn, New York.Set in Mississippi during the summer of 1964, Wiles's affecting debut children's book about two boysAone white and the other African-AmericanAunderscores the bittersweet aftermath of the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Rather than opening public pools, roller rinks and shops to African-Americans, many towns and private owners boarded up the doors. Wiles delivers her message incisively through the credible voices of her young characters, narrator Joe and his best friend, John Henry, whose mother works as housekeeper for Joe's family. Joe and John spend many hours swimming together in the creek because John is not allowed in the public pool, so on the day the Civil Rights Act is enacted, they visit the town pool together, excited about diving for nickels in the clear water. Instead they find a work crewAincluding John Henry's older brotherAfilling in the pool with asphalt. "John Henry's voice shakes. 'White folks don't want colored folks in their pool.' " The tale ends on an upbeat if tenuous note, as the boys walk together through the front door of a once-segregated shop to buy ice pops. Lagarrigue's (My Man Blue) softly focused, impressionistic paintings capture the lazy feel of summer days and affirm the bond between the two boys. The artist's close-up portraits of the boys' faces, as well as the body language of other characters, reinforce the narrative's powerful emotional pitch. Ages 4-8.

Among them, the "Enola Gay," the Japanese Zero used by kamikaze pilots, the German Komet jet fighter, and the spunky British spitfire that performed so valiantly in the Battle of Britain.<br>Colorists will find detailed information in captions concerning authentic coloring, markings, and insignia, as well as information about design innovations, each plane's military role and affiliation, and other pertinent data.

This love was revealed through Christ&#x2019;s coming into the&nbsp;world and living among humankind, and through his dying on the cross and rising from the dead. By Christ&#x2019;s death, God offers you forgiveness for your sins, and by his resurrection, the promise of everlasting life.</p><p>Christ died and rose again for the whole world,&nbsp;but for you to become a Christian is an individual matter. The only way to establish a personal relationship with Jesus Christ is to accept his offer of forgiveness and everlasting life. The following Scriptures show God&#x2019;s part and yours. Read each verse and believe it, for it is the Word of God speaking to you.</p><p>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16)</p><p>GOD&#x2019;S LOVE IS REVEALED</p><p>God loves you and all people. He wants to bless your life and make it full and complete. He offers you not only an abundant life here and now, but also a life that is eternal&#x2015; his very own life.</p><p>All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.&nbsp;(Romans 3:23)</p><p>HUMANS ARE SINFUL</p><p>The saying, &#x201c;Well, we are just human&#x2015; nobody is perfect,&#x201d; is biblically sound. When we acknowledge this truth, we can see our separation from God, for he is holy.</p><p>SIN HAS A PENALTY</p><p>The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23)</p><p>To continue in sin will result in spiritual death, which&nbsp;is separation from God forever. The alternative is to personally receive God&#x2019;s free gift, which is pardon for sin and provision of life everlasting.</p><p>CHRIST PAID THE PENALTY</p><p>God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8)</p><p>You may think you must lead a &#x201c;good&#x201d; life and do charitable acts before God will love you. This is not true. God loves you even in your sin. He sent Christ to die in your place and to pay the penalty for your sin so that you can be reconciled to him.</p><p>SALVATION IS A FREE GIFT!</p><p>By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8&#x2013;9)&nbsp;</p><p>Grace means undeserved favor. God graciously offers to you what you could never do for yourself. All you need to do is receive it. Believe with all your heart that Jesus Christ died to provide deliverance from your sins and to give you eternal life.</p><p>WE MUST RECEIVE CHRIST</p><p>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. (John 1:12)</p><p>When you receive Christ&#x2015; when you accept what he has done for you&#x2015; you become a child of God. Picture, if you will, Jesus Christ standing at the door of your life. Invite him in. He is waiting to be received into your life.</p><p>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16)</p><p>All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.&nbsp;(Romans 3:23)</p><p>The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23)</p><p>By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8&#x2013;9)</p><p>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. (John 1:12)</p><p>God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8)</p><p>RECEIVE CHRIST NOW</p><p>You can invite Jesus Christ into your life right now by praying to God something like the following:</p><p>Dear Lord, I know that I am a sinner and that&nbsp;I need your forgiveness. I believe that Jesus Christ died in my place to pay the penalty for my sin and that he rose from the dead. I now invite Jesus to come into my life as my Savior. Thank you for making me your child. Help me learn to please you in every part of my life.</p><p>GOD&#x2019;S PROMISES FROM HIS WORD</p><p>Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13)</p><p>By your belief in Jesus as your Savior and because of God&#x2019;s grace, the following has&nbsp;taken place in your life: your sins were forgiven (Colossians 1:14); you became a child of God (John 1:12); you were made an heir to all of God&#x2019;s blessings (Romans 8:16&#x2013;17); and you received everlasting life (1 John 5:12&#x2013;13)!</p><p>You became a Christian the moment you received Christ. Don&#x2019;t trust your feelings, for they will change. Take God at his Word and believe his promises. Review the above passages whenever doubts arise. You should be able to say with assurance, &#x201c;I have received Christ. On the authority of God&#x2019;s Word,&nbsp;I have eternal life.&#x201d;</p><p>MAY GOD GRANT YOU&nbsp;&#x201c;ALL JOY AND PEACE IN BELIEVING.&#x201d;&nbsp;ROMANS 15:13</p></p><p>Billy Graham, world-renowned preacher, evangelist, and author has delivered the Gospel message to more people face-to-face than anyone in history and has ministered on every continent of the world in more than 185 countries.

Anderson's <i>Feed</i>, young author Ned Vizzini draws on the very recent recollections of his years at Stuyvesant High School to create a witty commentary on the annoying realities of teen social life. <p> Jeremy Heere is convinced that people are born Cool: "See, because being Cool is obviously the most important thing on earth...It's more important than getting a job, or having a girlfriend, or political power, or money, because all those things are predicated by Coolness." And he hasn't got it. Every day he yearns hopelessly for beautiful Christine. Then, one day he gets a squip--a tiny quantum supercomputer that looks like a little gray capsule and when swallowed becomes a voice in his head instructing him in the ways of Cool. Soon, every gril he admires is his--including Christine. But when the squip turns malevolent in its merciless pursuit of the goal, Jeremy begins to realize that Cool is not as cool as he thought it was.

You may recall your childhood as a time when your emotional needs were not met, when your feelings were dismissed, or when you took on adult levels of responsibility in an effort to compensate for your parent&#39;s behavior. These wounds can be healed, and you can move forward in your life. In this breakthrough book, clinical psychologist Lindsay Gibson exposes the destructive nature of parents who are emotionally immature or unavailable. You will see how these parents create a sense of neglect, and discover ways to heal from the pain and confusion caused by your childhood. By freeing yourself from your parents&#39; emotional immaturity, you can recover your true nature, control how you react to them, and avoid disappointment. Finally, you&#39;ll learn how to create positive, new relationships so you can build a better life. Discover the four types of difficult parents: The emotional parent instills feelings of instability and anxiety The driven parent stays busy trying to perfect everything and everyone The passive parent avoids dealing with anything upsetting The rejecting parent is withdrawn, dismissive, and derogatory.</p><p><b>Lindsay C.

Readers are first introduced to Tionna, a single mom of two, desperate to recover her footing after her man gets arrested for his involvement in drug and gun dealing. Moving back to her old neighborhood in shame, Tionna devises a plan with her girlfriends&#x2014;Gucci, Boots and Tracy&#x2014;to con local record label mogul Don B. Meanwhile, Gucci meets and falls for Animal, a notorious criminal who's on the fence about going legitimate as a rapper. As their pursuits intertwine, Tionna and friends find much to learn about unintended consequences. Quick and entertaining, K'wan's latest captures a small slice of modern urban life with a great degree of credibility and finds in Animal his most conflicted, memorable and likable character yet. Unfortunately, the plot hinges on some implausible (and cheesy) developments, which may try readers' patience. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s story is a work of major historical importance, a narrative that <i>The Washington Times</i> calls &#x201c;one of our classic American success stories.&#x201d;<br><br>Few presidents have accomplished more, or been so effective in changing the direction of government in ways that are both fundamental and lasting, than Ronald Reagan. Certainly no president has more dramatically raised the American spirit, or done so much to restore national strength and self-confidence. <br><br>Here, then, is a truly American success story&#x2014;a great and inspiring one. From modest beginnings as the son of a shoe salesman in Tampico, Illinois, Ronald Reagan achieved first a distinguished career in Hollywood and then, as governor of California and as president of the most powerful nation in the world, a career of public service unique in our history. <br><br>Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s account of that rise is told here with all the uncompromising candor, modesty, and wit that made him perhaps the most able communicator ever to occupy the White House, and also with the sense of drama of a gifted natural storyteller. <br><br>He tells us, with warmth and pride, of his early years and of the elements that made him, in later life, a leader of such stubborn integrity, courage, and clear-minded optimism. Reading the account of this childhood, we understand how his parents, struggling to make ends meet despite family problems and the rigors of the Depression, shaped his belief in the virtues of American life&#x2014;the need to help others, the desire to get ahead and to get things done, the deep trust in the basic goodness, values, and sense of justice of the American people&#x2014;virtues that few presidents have expressed more eloquently than Ronald Reagan. <br><br>With absolute authority and a keen eye for the details and the anecdotes that humanize history, Ronald Reagan takes the reader behind the scenes of his extraordinary career, from his first political experiences as president of the Screen Actors Guild (including his first meeting with a beautiful young actress who was later to become Nancy Reagan) to such high points of his presidency as the November 1985 Geneva meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, during which Reagan invited the Soviet leader outside for a breath of fresh air and then took him off for a walk and a man-to-man chat, without aides, that set the course for arms reduction and charted the end of the Cold War.<br> <br>Here he reveals what went on behind his decision to enter politics and run for the governorship of California, the speech nominating Barry Goldwater that first made Reagan a national political figure, his race for the presidency, his relations with the members of his own cabinet, and his frustrations with Congress. <br><br>He gives us the details of the great themes and dramatic crises of his eight years in office, from Lebanon to Grenada, from the struggle to achieve arms control to tax reform, from Iran-Contra to the visits abroad that did so much to reestablish the United States in the eyes of the world as a friendly and peaceful power. His narrative is full of insights, from the unseen dangers of Gorbachev&#x2019;s first visit to the United States to Reagan&#x2019;s own personal correspondence with major foreign leaders, as well as his innermost feelings about life in the White House, the assassination attempt, his family&#x2014;and the enduring love between himself and Mrs. Reagan. <br><br><i>An American Life </i>is a warm, richly detailed, and deeply human book, a brilliant self-portrait, a significant work of history.</p><p>Ronald Reagan was the 40th President of the United States of America. He served two terms as President, from 1981 to 1989.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>If I'd gotten the job I wanted at Montgomery Ward, I suppose I would never have left Illinois.<br><br>I've often wondered at how lives are shaped by what seem like small and inconsequential events, how an apparently random turn in the road can lead you a long way from where you intended to go -- and a long way from wherever you expected to go. For me, the first of these turns occurred in the summer of 1932, in the abyss of the Depression.<br><br>They were cheerless, desperate days. I don't think anyone who did not live through the Depression can ever understand how difficult it was. In the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt, "the country was dying by inches." There were millions of people out of work. The unemployment rate across the country was over twenty-six percent. Every day the radio crackled with announcements warning people not to leave home in search of work because, the announcer said, there were no jobs to be found anywhere. There were no jobs, and for many, it seemed as if there was no hope.<br><br>In Dixon, the town in northwestern Illinois where I lived, many families had lost their land to crushing debt; the cement plant that provided many of the jobs had closed; on downtown streets there were perpetual clusters of men huddled outside boarded-up shops.<br><br>I'd been lucky. In the summer of 1932, I'd been able to work a seventh summer as a lifeguard at nearby Lowell Park and had saved enough money to finance a job-hunting trip. I had a new college diploma that summer and a lot of dreams.<br><br>Keeping it secret from my father -- I knew he believed those daily announcements and would have said it was a waste of time for me to leave Dixon in search of a job -- I hitchhiked to Chicago after the swimming season ended with visions of getting a job as a radio announcer. But all I got was rejection: No one wanted an inexperienced kid, especially during the Depression. And so I had hitchhiked back to Dixon in a storm, my dreams all but smothered by this introduction to reality.<br><br>If there was ever a time in my life when my spirits hit bottom, it was probably the day I thumbed my way back to Dixon in the rain, tired, defeated, and broke.<br><br>But when I got home, my dad told me he had some good news: The Montgomery Ward Company had just decided to open a store in Dixon and was looking for someone who had been prominent in local high school sports to manage the sporting goods department. The job paid $12.50 a week.<br><br>Suddenly, I had a new dream -- not one as seductive as my <i>real</i> dream, but one that seemed to be more grounded in reality, and for a time late that summer, nothing in the world was as important to me as managing the sporting goods department of the new Montgomery Ward store. I loved sports; I'd lettered in football in high school and college and loved just about every other sport there was. The job offered me the chance not only to help out my family financially at a time it really needed it, but to get started on a life career. Even during the Depression, Montgomery Ward had a reputation as a steady employer and I knew that if I did well in the sporting goods department, promotions would follow.<br><br>I told my father I'd run the best sporting goods department Montgomery Ward had ever seen, and when I applied for the job with the manager of the store, I told him the same thing, and then waited for his decision.<br><br>His decision several days later was a heartbreaker. He gave the job to a former superstar on our high school basketball team.<br><br>I was raised to believe that God has a plan for everyone and that seemingly random twists of fate are all a part of His plan. My mother -- a small woman with auburn hair and a sense of optimism that ran as deep as the cosmos -- told me that everything in life happened for a purpose. She said all things were part of God's Plan, even the most disheartening setbacks, and in the end, everything worked out for the best. If something went wrong, she said, you didn't let it get you down: You stepped away from it, stepped over it, and moved on. Later on, she added, something good will happen and you'll find yourself thinking -- "If I hadn't had that problem back then, then this better thing that <i>did</i> happen wouldn't have happened to me."<br><br>After I lost the job at Montgomery Ward, I left home again in search of work. Although I didn't know it then, I was beginning a journey that would take me a long way from Dixon and fulfill all my dreams and then some.<br><br>My mother, as usual, was right.<br><br>I was born February 6, 1911, in a flat above the local bank in Tampico, Illinois. According to family legend, when my father ran up the stairs and looked at his newborn son, he quipped: "He looks like a fat little Dutchman. But who knows, he might grow up to be president some day."<br><br>During my mother's pregnancy, my parents had decided to call me Donald. But after one of her sisters beat her to it and named her son Donald, I became Ronald.<br><br>I never thought "Ronald" was rugged enough for a young red-blooded American boy and as soon as I could, I asked people to call me "Dutch." That was a nickname that grew out of my father's calling me "the Dutchman" whenever he referred to me.<br><br>My delivery, I was told, was a difficult one and my mother was informed that she shouldn't have any more children. So that left four of us -- Jack, Nelle, and my brother, Neil, who had been born two years earlier.<br><br>My dad -- his name was John Edward Reagan but everyone called him Jack -- was destined by God, I think, to be a salesman.<br><br>His forebears had come to America from County Tipperary by way of England during Ireland's potato famine and he was endowed with the gift of blarney and the charm of a leprechaun. No one I ever met could tell a story better than he could.<br><br>He was twenty-nine when I came into his life. Like my mother's, his education had ended after a few years in grade school. He had lost both of his parents to a respiratory illness that people in those days called "consumption" before he was six years old and was brought up by an elderly aunt who raised him a proper Irish Catholic.<br><br>Despite the brevity of his formal schooling, Jack had a lot of what people now call "street smarts." Like a lot of Americans whose roots were on the nineteenth-century frontier, he was restless, always ready to pull up stakes and move on in search of a better life for himself and his family.<br><br>My dad believed passionately in the rights of the individual and the working man, and he was suspicious of established authority, especially the Republican politicians who ran the Illinois state government, which he considered as corrupt as Tammany Hall.<br><br>Among the things he passed on to me were the belief that all men and women, regardless of their color or religion, are created equal and that individuals determine their own destiny; that is, it's largely their own ambition and hard work that determine their fate in life.<br><br>Although I think Jack could have sold anything, his specialty was shoes. A large part of his life Jack pursued a singular dream: He wanted to own a shoe store...not an ordinary shoe shop, but the best, with the largest inventory in Illinois, outside Chicago.<br><br>Nelle Wilson Reagan, my mother, was of Scots-English ancestry.<br><br>She met and fell in love with my father shortly after the turn of the century in one of the tiny farm towns that were planted on the Illinois prairie by pioneers as they moved westward across the continent during the nineteenth century. They were married in Fulton, Illinois, about forty miles from Dixon, in 1904.<br><br>While my father was a cynic and tended to suspect the worst of people, my mother was the opposite.<br><br>She always expected to find the best in people and often did, even among the prisoners at our local jail to whom she frequently brought hot meals.<br><br>I learned from my father the value of hard work and ambition, and maybe a little something about telling a story.<br><br>From my mother, I learned the value of prayer, how to have dreams and believe I could make them come true.<br><br>Although my father's attendance at Catholic Mass was sporadic, my mother seldom missed Sunday services at the Disciples of Christ church in Dixon. Like Jack, she had a natural and intuitive intelligence that went a long way toward overcoming a shortage of formal schooling. While my father was filled with dreams of making something of himself, she had a drive to help my brother and me make something of ourselves.<br><br>My brother and I never knew our grandparents. They had all died before we were born. My father had one brother, but they lived far apart and seldom saw each other. My mother, on the other hand, had five sisters and brothers and it was a very close family; one sister was married to a farmer and they owned a big farm and a country store and we'd visit with them during the heat of the summer; another sister lived in Quincy, Illinois, and sometimes we'd go there for a vacation. Once, we visited another of my mother's sisters who ran a hotel in the Ozark mountains; she had an only son and later, for some reason or other -- I don't know what happened -- she was no longer managing the hotel and had to move in with us with her son, and we all lived together for a while.<br><br>When I was a child, we moved a lot. My father was constantly searching for a better life and I was forever the new kid in school. During one period of four years, I attended four different schools. We moved to wherever my father's ambition took him.<br><br>Tampico, the place where I was born, had a population of only 820. There was a short paved main street, a railroad station, two or three churches, and a couple of stores, including the one where my father worked.<br><br>When I was a baby, we moved from the flat above the bank into a house facing a park in the center of Tampico that had a Civil War cannon flanked by a pyramid of cannonballs. One of my first memories was of crossing the park with my brother on our way to an ice wagon that had pulled up to the depot.<br><br>A pair of toddlers intent on plucking some refreshing shards of ice from the back of the wagon, we crawled over the tracks beneath a huge freight train that had just pulled in. We'd hardly made it when the train pulled out with a hissing burst of steam. Our mother, who had come out on the porch in time to see the escapade, met us in the middle of the park and inflicted the appropriate punishment.<br><br>When I was two, we moved to Chicago, where my father had gotten a promising job selling shoes at the Marshall Field's department store. We moved into a small flat near the University of Chicago that was lighted by a single gas let brought to life with the deposit of a quarter in a slot down the hall.<br><br>Jack's job didn't pay as well as he had hoped, and that meant Nelle had to make a soup bone last several days and be creative in other ways with her cooking. On Saturdays, she usually sent my brother to the butcher with a request for some liver (liver wasn't very popular in those days) to feed our family cat -- which didn't exist. The liver became our Sunday dinner.<br><br>In Chicago I got a serious case of bronchial pneumonia and while I was recuperating one of our neighbors brought me several of his son's lead soldiers. I spent hours standing them up on the bed covers and pushing them back and forth in mock combat. To this day I get a little thrill out of seeing a cabinet full of toy soldiers.<br><br>Our stay in Chicago introduced me to a congested urban world of gaslit sidewalks and streets alive with people, carriages, trolley cars, and occasional automobiles. Once, while watching a clanging horse-drawn fire engine race past me with a cloud of steam rising behind it, I decided that it was my intention in life to become a fireman.<br><br>After we'd been in Chicago for less than two years, Jack was offered a job at 0. T. Johnson's, a big department store in Galesburg 140 miles to the west of Chicago, and we moved again, this time to a completely different world. Instead of noisy streets and crowds of people, it consisted of meadows and caves, trees and streams, and the joys of small-town life. From that time onward, I guess I've always been partial to small towns and the outdoors.<br><br>We lived at first in a rented bungalow on the edge of Galesburg, then rented a larger house with a big lawn a block away -- and it was there that I began my career as the Great Naturalist.<br><br>In the attic of the house, a previous tenant -- an anonymous benefactor to whom I owe much -- had left behind a huge collection of birds' eggs and butterflies enclosed in glass cases. Mentally appropriating the collections, I escaped for hours at a time into the attic, marveling at the rich colors of the eggs and the intricate and fragile wings of the butterflies. The experience left me with a reverence for the handiwork of God that never left me.<br><br>By the time I entered the first grade in Galesburg, I was already a bookworm of sorts. I don't have any recollection of ever learning how to read, but I remember my father coming into the house one day before I'd entered school and finding me on the living room floor with a newspaper in front of me. "What are you doing?" he asked, and I said, "Reading the paper."<br><br>Well, I imagine he thought I was being a bit of a smart aleck, so he said, "Okay, read something to me," and I did.<br><br>The next thing I knew, he was flying out the front door and from the porch inviting all our neighbors to come over and hear his five-year-old son read.<br><br>I suspect I'd learned how to read through a kind of osmosis: My mother always came into our room at bedtime and wedged herself between my brother and me to read us a story. As she read, she followed each line on the page with her finger and we watched. I think I just picked it up that way.<br><br>After entering school I discovered I had a pretty good memory. I could pick up something to read and memorize it fairly quickly, a lucky trait that made schoolwork easier for me but sometimes annoyed my brother, who didn't have the same ability.<br><br>My dad was happy at first with his job in Galesburg. But my brother and I often heard him telling Nelle that he would soon be doing better. There was a great deal of love between Jack and Nelle, but in Galesburg I began to suspect there was also a mysterious source of conflict between them.<br><br>Sometimes, my father suddenly disappeared and didn't come home for days, and sometimes when he did return, my brother and I would hear some pretty fiery arguments through the walls of our house; if we'd come into the room where Jack and Nelle were talking, they'd look at each other pointedly and start talking about something else.<br><br>There were other mysteries in our household: Sometimes out of the blue my mother bundled us up and took us to visit one of her sisters and we'd be gone for several days. We loved the unexpected vacations but were mystified by them.<br><br>World War I started when we were in Galesburg. Like almost every other American during those years, I was filled with pride every time I heard a band play "Over There" or I thought of our doughboys crossing the Atlantic on a noble mission to save our friends in Europe. There were some days when everybody in Galesburg dropped whatever they were doing and rushed down to the depot to cheer on a troop train passing through town. The train windows were usually open to the air and the doughboys would be in their khaki uniforms and would wave to us; we waved back and cheered. Once my mother picked me up and gave me a penny, which I gave to a soldier, saying in my small voice, "Good luck." Another time, there was a big show at the school to raise money for the war and the whole family went. My dad -- who as a...</p><h2>The Ultimate Survival Manual (Paperback Edition): Modern Day Survival | Avoid Diseases | Quarantine Tips (Outdoor Life)</h2><p>Whether you&#x2019;re lost in the woods, facing an armed insurrection, or preparing for a hurricane, the experts at&nbsp;<i>Outdoor Life</i>&nbsp;magazine are the people you want on your side.

Sample topics include gratitude, harmony, self-nurturing, positive body image, the importance of scented linen closets, and many others. Each essay sports a pithy quote from (surprise!) the likes of Kahlil Gibran. Viewed uncritically, it's hard to argue with <i>Simple Abundance</i>'s earnest admonitions to appreciate life, in all its messy imperfect excellence. And the fact that serenity and happiness are each in dreadfully short supply can excuse some of the treacly writing. But Breathnach sometimes lapses into what can only be described as her "Martha Stewart on Prozac" voice, and the results are aggravating to the extreme: "If you've been hesitant to strike up a reciprocal relationship with your guardian angel, don't be." Fans of guardian angels will greet these feel-good essays every morning with the rising sun, a cup of mint tea, and a bluebird chirping on the windowsill, and be happy. Skeptics will prefer their coffee very black.Sarah Ban Breathnach is the founder of the Simple Abundance Charitable Trust, a nonprofit bridge group between charitable causes and the public, dedicated to increasing awareness that &#39;doing good&#39; and &#39;living the good life&#39; are soul mates.

But a quiet bird captures the children&#x2019;s attention. Sitting in her nest in a tree, the robin is alert but silent. The next morning, the duo hears sounds from the nest, beginning with &#x201c;tapping cracking&#x201d; and ending with &#x201c;breaking shaking.&#x201d; Three baby birds join the robin and her mate in the nest. The appended &#x201c;A Word with the Bird&#x201d; section, cleverly written as a Q&amp;A with the robin, offers a short, highly readable account of life in the nest before and after the eggs hatch. Included is an explanation of why the nesting bird is quiet: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want other animals to know I am hiding eggs. They might eat them!&#x201d; The pleasing text is well constructed, with rhythm and rhyme altered in different types of stanzas, and distinctive birdsongs included in the verse. In his picture-book debut, Pak&#x2019;s collage-style artwork is distinctive, dynamic, and rewarding to look at again and again. Retro in style, the watercolor-and-digital-media illustrations make good use of varied perspectives, layouts, and lighting effects. A beautifully crafted, informative picture book.

Dialogue is necessary but never sufficient, and often actions prove inadequate to produce substantial change. Even worse, chosen actions create more conflict because people have different lived experiences, priorities, and approaches to transformation. So what&#x2019;s the story?<br><br>In <i>The Little Book of Transformative Community Conferencing</i>, David Anderson Hooker offers a hopeful, accessible approach to dialogue that:<br><ul><li>Integrates several practice approaches including restorative justice, peacebuilding, and arts</li><li>Creates welcoming, non-divisive spaces for dialogue</li><li>Names and maps complex conflicts, such as racial tensions, religious divisions, environmental issues, and community development as it narrates simple stories</li><li>Builds relationships and foundations for trust needed to support long-term community transformation projects</li><li>And results in the crafting of hopeful, future-oriented visions of community that can transform relationships, resource allocation, and structures in service of communities&#x2019; preferred narratives.</li></ul><br>Hooker presents an important, stand-alone process, an excellent addition to the study and practice of strategic peacebuilding, restorative justice, conflict transformation, trauma healing, and community organizing.<br><br>This book recognizes the complexity of conflict, choosing long-term solutions over inadequate quick fixes. The Transformative Community Conferencing model emerges from the author&#x2019;s thirty years of practice in contexts as diverse as South Sudan; Mississippi; Greensboro, North Carolina; Oakland, California; and Nassau, Bahamas.</p><p><b>David Anderson Hooker, PhD, JD, MDiv</b>, is an independent practitioner and scholar with more than 30 years&#x2019; experience in conflict transformation, peacebuilding, and community organizing.

Stine&#39;s books have sold more than 300 million copies, making him one of the most popular children&#39;s authors in history. Besides Goosebumps, R.L.

The mental exercise that audio gives to the imagination has more positive effects on kids than the mind-numbing boob tube. Perhaps that&#39;s why, when Disney rereleased some of its postwar kids albums on cassette a few years ago, they were sold out within weeks of hitting the shelves. In this instance, even merely serviceable performance does wonders for Stine&#39;s hack writing. Disney has pumped more energy than creativity into the slickly produced title. It&#39;s amiable, briskly paced and safe. Neither parents nor their offspring will find any unpleasant shocks here. When you give it to your kids, tell &#39;em to shut their eyes and give their minds a listen. Y.R.

So it seemed only appropriate when his father learned he had two months to live that they would set off on the golf journey of their dreams to play the most famous courses in the world.<br><br><i>Final Rounds</i> takes us to the historic courses of Royal Lytham and Royal Birkdale, to the windswept undulations of Carnoustie, where Hogan played peerlessly in '53, and the legendary St. Andrews, whose hallowed course reveals something of the eternal secret of the game's mysterious allure over pros and hackers alike.<br><br>Throughout their poignant journey, the Dodsons humorously reminisce and reaffirm their love for each other, as the younger Dodson finds out what it means to have his father also be his best friend. <i>Final Rounds</i> is a book never to be forgotten, a book about fathers and sons, long-held secrets, and the lessons a middle-aged man can still learn from his dad about life, love, and family.<br><br><i>Final Rounds</i> is a tribute to a very special game and the fathers and sons who make it so.</p><p>The Dodsons always knew where to go to solve their problems: the golf course. For decades, father and son took refuge there together; in the game, they found connection. Dodson <i>fils</i>'s memoir of his last lyrical golf excursion with his father, taken through England and Scotland in the months before his father's death, is alternately heartwarming and heartbreaking. <i>Final Rounds</i> is as straight a shot into the heart of golf's magnetic hold on golfers--and the tie that binds fathers and sons--as a 300-yard drive that splits the fairway."A beautiful, deeply moving tribute to the love between father and son and their shared passion for golf. I have never read a more eloquent book about golf as a game where hearts can meet."<br>--Michael Murphy, author of <i>Golf in the Kingdom</i><p>"James Dodson is a gifted writer who clearly understands and loves golf, but more importantly, he understands people and relationships. In the truest sense, final rounds is a moving love story."<br>--John Feinstein, author of <i>The Majors</i></p><p>"A gripping, loving, and moving story...James Dodson is an excellent writer who understands golf...better than most." <br>--Ely Callaway, founder and chairman of Callaway Golf</p><p>"<i>Final Rounds</i> is about much more than the game itself.

Sonia lives in Barcelona, Spain.</p>PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;A basic introduction to community gardens for youngsters. Beginning with a lush, rural landscape with old houses, picket fences, and a young family gardening in their spacious yard, the narrative shows bulldozers arriving as "stone and metal, the city grows." Rather suddenly, viewers are in an established urban landscape of high-rise buildings and neglected, overgrown lots. Green and brown have turned to "pigeon blue and squirrel gray," though plants still peek out from "in between" pavement cracks and balcony planter boxes. The colored pencil illustrations depict a diverse cast of children and adults of all ages who see an overgrown city lot and with the repeated refrain of "Brown brown,/dig the ground" transform it into a vibrant garden. Back matter includes additional information on community gardens and pollinators as well as a butterfly craft project. The simple text pairs well with the detailed visuals, each spread packed with movement and activity. However, while the overarching theme of urban development followed by green redevelopment may be clear to adult readers, young audiences viewing the images may be confused by gaps. For example, the same family depicted gardening in the countryside at the opening of the story is shown just a few pages later, following some quick construction, on top of a building, admiring the night sky. It isn't obvious whether they moved to the city or the city sprung up around them within a very short time frame. VERDICT Though slightly marred by a confusing time line, this is nonetheless an attractive read-aloud for beginning lessons on gardening. A strong addition to most shelves.&#x2014;Chelsea Couillard-Smith, Hennepin County Library, MN</p><h2>Neuroscientist Who Lost Her Mind</h2><p><b>As a deadly cancer spread inside her brain, leading neuroscientist Barbara Lipska was plunged into madness&#x2014;only to miraculously survive with her memories intact.

Her multiple case examples are spot-on and offer concrete, practical clinical guidance. This book is well organized, user friendly, and easy to follow.

When the world did crash, his family&#x2019;s home of Stonemont became not only a refuge, but a place where it might be possible to start over again, and reclaim the American ideal. Among the many novels in the SHTF/TEOTWAWKI genre, The Reversion stands apart &#x2013; and, perhaps, alone. It does not follow the survival learning curve of the unprepared or minimally-prepared, as so many excellent books have already done so well. Rather, it is the story of a man who was prepared, and of how his preparation and foresight provided not only a safe haven for him and his family, but a re-start point for those who come together to survive the collapse of the world around them. As such, it is an unbelievably positive book about an unbelievably negative circumstance, and carries within it the lessons of preparedness and survival that every person should strive to learn. Tightly woven into the story are threads of history, morality, politics, economics, philosophy and comparative justice &#x2013; the kind America was founded on, the kind they had devolved to under the weight of an increasingly liberal and socialist society, and the kind that might re-establish a society reflective of America&#x2019;s original ideals. As these threads are woven into the fabric of the larger story of survival, the realization emerges that a great catastrophe enabled the return of what makes us, as human beings, truly happy and fulfilled, and that, perhaps, only a great catastrophe could. The Reversion, written by an expert in survival and preparedness with an interesting government and non-government background, is destined to be an instant classic in the preparedness/survival genre. More than a good story, it is a manual and a resource for all who are interested in these fields, and deserves to be kept on your desk or chair-side table where it can be read, re-read and referred to often.</p><p>Steven Smith is a former police officer and deputy sheriff with a long history of survival and preparedness experience.

And yet, what could be more sacred or profound? Food is our most intimate and telling connection both with the natural order and with our cultural heritage. But it is increasingly clear that the choices we make about food today are leading to environmental degradation, enormous human health problems, and unimaginable cruelty toward our fellow creatures.</p> <p><i>The World Peace Diet</i> presents the outlines of a more empowering understanding of our world, based on comprehending the far-reaching implications of our food choices. Incorporating systems theory, teachings from mythology and religions, and the human sciences, Will Tuttle offers a set of universal principles for all people of conscience, from any religious tradition, that show how we as a species can move our consciousness forward&#x2015;allowing us to become more free, more intelligent, more loving, and happier in the choices we make.</p> <p>&nbsp;Since it was published in 2005, <i>The World Peace Diet</i> and author Will Tuttle have reached hundreds of thousands of people around the globe and created a whole new movement of people making a conscious connection with a healthful diet and cruelty-free living, and committing spiritually, psychologically, and socially to nonviolence and genuine sustainability. This tenth anniversary edition contains a new foreword, new resources (including recipes), and a study guide.</p><br></p><p><b>Dr. Will Tuttle</b> is a recipient of the Courage of Conscience Award and the Empty Cages Prize.

With his spouse Madeleine, a Swiss visionary artist, he presents lectures, workshops, and concerts throughout North America and worldwide....one of the most provocative books I ve ever read. I felt challenged and stimulated by its profound insights, and called to question ever more deeply what Will Tuttle calls the taboo against knowing what you eat. This book . . . expose[s] the complacency of a culture. --John Robbins, author, <i>Diet For a New America and The Food Revolution</i><br><br>As Gandhi observed, our fork can be a weapon of violence. Will Tuttle reminds us of this simple truth and invites us to keep violence off our plate by adopting a vegan way of being in the world. Everyone who works for peace will gain knowledge and draw inspiration from this fine book. --Tom Regan, author, <i>Empty Cages: Facing the Challenge of Animal Rights</i><br><br>Food is our most intimate and telling connection both with the living natural order and with our living cultural heritage. By eating the plants and animals of our earth, we literally incorporate them. It is also through this act of eating that we partake of our culture s values and paradigms at the most primal levels. It is becoming increasingly obvious, however, that the choices we make about our food are leading to environmental degradation, enormous human health problems, and unimaginable cruelty toward our fellow creatures.<blockquote>I ve spent the last 30 years exploring the fascinating connections and cause-effect relationships between our individual and cultural practice of using animals for food and the stress and difficulties we create for each other and ourselves. I ve discovered that the violence we instigate for our plates boomerangs in remarkable ways.</blockquote>Incorporating systems theory, teachings from mythology and religions, and the human sciences, <i>The World Peace Diet</i> presents the outlines of a more empowering understanding of our world, based on a comprehension of the far-reaching cultural and spiritual implications of our food choices and the worldview those choices reflect and mandate. The author offers a set of universal principles for all people of conscience, from any religious tradition, that they can follow to reconnect with what we are eating, what was required to get it on our plate, and what happens after it leaves our plates.<blockquote>The song of the new mythos that yearns to be born through us requires our spirits to be loving and alive enough to hear and recognize the pain we are causing through our obsolete food orientation. We are called to allow our innate mercy and kindness to shine forth and to confront the indoctrinated assumptions that promote cruelty.</blockquote> Will Tuttle brings a priceless perspective not only to the planetary crisis confronting us all, but also to powerful ways we each can affect it. This book is radiant with his learning and his compassion. --Joanna Macy, author, <i>Coming Back to Life</i></p><h2>Michelin Iceland Map 750 (Michelin Map)</h2><p>Michelin Iceland Map 750 is a new addition to Michelin&#x2019;s Country Map series.

Farquharson and features an introduction by John Sellars.</p><p> Marcus Aurelius was a follower of the Stoic tradition of philosophy, and one of its finest advocates, both in the clarity of his writing and in the uprightness of his life. The aphorisms show how for him, as perhaps for us all, the answer to life lies in keeping a calm and rational mind, and in refusing to be cast down or alarmed by things over which we have no control.</p></p><p>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was born in 121 AD. He is believed to have been a bookish young boy who studied with a number of Stoic philosophers. He had a reputation for virtue from a young age and was subsequently adopted into the imperial family. This led to him becoming Emperor of Rome, a post he held from 161 until his death in 180.</p><h2>Our National Parks</h2><p>John Muir (1838&#x2013;1914) ranks among America's most important and influential environmentalists and nature writers.

Visit her at SusanMallery.com."DID TYLER MAKE THAT FOR YOU?"<br><br>Nicole Lord turned to look at the picture she'd posted on the wall of Mischief in Motion, her Pilates studio. Three large red hearts covered a piece of pink construction paper. A handprint had been outlined over the hearts. The hearts were wobbly and highly stylized, but still recognizable. Not bad, considering the artist in question was not yet five. The handprint had been traced by one of his teachers.<br><br>"He did," Nicole said with a smile. "I promised him I would bring it to work and show everyone."<br><br>Her client, a thirtysomething fighting her way back from a forty-five-pound pregnancy weight gain, wiped sweat from her face and smiled. "He sounds adorable. I look forward to when my daughter can do more than eat, poop and keep me up all night."<br><br>"It gets better," Nicole promised.<br><br>"I hope so. I'd always assumed once I started having kids, I'd want six." The woman grimaced. "Now one is looking like more than enough." She waved and walked toward the exit. "See you next week."<br><br>"Have a good weekend."<br><br>Nicole spoke without looking, her attention already back on her computer. She had her noon class, then a three-hour break before her late-afternoon classes. Which sounded nice until she thought about all she had to get done. Grocery shopping for sure&#x2014;they were out of everything. Her car needed gas, there was dry cleaning to pick up and somewhere in the middle of all that, she should eat lunch.<br><br>She glanced at the clock, wondering if she should text Eric to remind him to pick up Tyler from day care at four. She reached for her phone, then shook her head and sagged back in her chair. No, she shouldn't, she told herself. He'd only forgotten once and he'd felt awful about it. She had to trust him not to forget again.<br><br>Which she would, she told herself. Only these days he was forgetting a lot of things. And helping less around the house.<br><br>Marriage, she thought ruefully. It all sounded so romantic until you realized that hey, you not only had to live with someone else, but there would also be days when they actually thought you were wrong about things.<br><br>She was still trying to figure out in which order she was going to run her errands when the door to her studio opened and Pam Eiland strolled in.<br><br>"Hey, you," Pam called cheerfully, an oversize tote hanging off one shoulder.<br><br>Anyone who didn't know Pam would assume she had a clutter problem if she needed to haul around that much stuff in her bag. Those who did know Pam were privy to the fact that her actual handbag was fairly small and that most of the space in the tote was taken up by a soft blanket and a very weird-looking dog.<br><br>Right on cue, Lulu poked her head out of the tote and whined softly.<br><br>Nicole stood and approached them both. After giving Pam a hug, she reached for Lulu. The dog leaped into her arms and snuggled close.<br><br>"I see you're in pink today," she said, stroking Lulu's cheek, then rubbing the top of her head.<br><br>"We both felt it was a pink kind of day," Pam told her.<br><br>Lulu, a purebred Chinese crested, had white hair on the top of her head, by her ears and on her tail and lower legs. The rest of her spotted body was pretty much naked and an unexpected shade of grayish pink with brown spots. Her health issues were legendary and what with having no fur, she was chronically cold. Which meant Lulu had a collection of sweaters, jackets and T-shirts. Today's selection was a lightweight, sleeveless pink sweater trimmed with shiny gray ribbon. With money tight and her own clothes threadbare, Nicole found herself in the embarrassing situation of envying a dog's wardrobe.<br><br>Lulu gave her a quick puppy-kiss on the chin. Nicole held onto the warm dog for a few seconds more. Her relationship with Lulu was the least emotionally charged moment in her day thus far, and she was determined to enjoy it.<br><br>Pam, a pretty brunette with an easy smile, wore a loose short-sleeved dress over her leggings and workout tank. Unlike the other clients who came in for the noon class, Pam didn't walk over from an office. Nicole knew the other woman had held a job at her husband's company years ago. She understood how a small business worked and often gave Nicole sound advice. Aside from that, Pam seemed to have her days to herself. Right now that sounded like a dream come true.<br><br>"Who's coming today?" Pam asked as she pulled the blanket out of the tote and folded it before setting it in a corner of the room. Lulu obligingly curled up, with her long legs tucked gracefully under her body. Nicole knew the dog wouldn't budge until class was over. She supposed the sweet temperament and excellent manners made up for Lulu's odd and faintly sci-fi appearance.<br><br>"Just you and Shannon," Nicole said, clicking on her computer's scheduling program to confirm. She was actually relieved to have a smaller class. Lately she was so damned tired all the time. Pam and Shannon could have run the workout themselves, so there wouldn't be pressure to stay on top of every move.<br><br>Even better, all three dropouts had come in early that morning. The studio had a strict twenty-four-hour cancellation policy, which meant she was going to be paid for five students regardless. She accepted her momentary pleasure even though the thought made her a bad person, and vowed she would work on her character just as soon as she figured out how to fix what was going on with her marriage and got more than four hours of sleep on any given night.<br><br>Pam had slipped off her sandals in preparation for class. But instead of putting on her Pilates socks, she turned to Nicole and grinned.<br><br>"Want to go to lunch?"<br><br>Pam's smile was infectious. Her hazel-green eyes crinkled at the corners and her mouth curved up.<br><br>"Come on," Pam teased. "You know you want to."<br><br>"Want to what?" Shannon Rigg asked as she walked into the studio. "I've had a horrible morning dealing with a mi-sogynistic idiot from the bank who insisted on continually asking to speak to my supervisor. When I explained I was the CFO of the company, I think he had a seizure." She paused, her blue eyes dancing with amusement. "I offered to send him a scanned copy of my business card, but he declined. Then I told him that if he didn't get his act together, I would be moving the company's four-hundred-million-dollar account to another bank." She paused for dramatic effect. "I think I made him cry."<br><br>Pam held out her arm, hand raised, for a high five. "You both constantly impress me. Nicole juggles her husband, her five-year-old son and her growing business. You're busy frightening men who really should know better. I, on the other hand, will pick out my dog's wardrobe for tomorrow and make biscuits from scratch. It's sad."<br><br>"I don't even know what you put in the bowl to make a biscuit," Shannon admitted as she gave her friend a high five, then turned to Nicole. "Do you?"<br><br>"Flour, water, something else."<br><br>Shannon laughed. "Yeah, that's where I would get lost, too. It's the something else that always gets you."<br><br>Nicole thought about how Pam had described her. Juggling sounded so perky and positive. Unfortunately most days she found herself cleaning up what had fallen and shattered rather than keeping her plates spinning in the air.<br><br>Okay, that was a confused and slightly depressing analogy. She really needed to think more positively. And maybe learn how to make biscuits.<br><br>Shannon had on a tailored sleeveless dress and three-inch pumps. Her legs were bare and tanned, her hair a glorious tumbling mass of auburn waves that fell past her shoulders. She wore expensive watches and elegant jewelry. She drove a BMW convertible. If Nicole could pick, she would want Pam for her mother and to be Shannon when she grew up.<br><br>Only at thirty, Nicole had a feeling she was about as grownup as she was going to get.<br><br>"Wait," Pam said as Shannon headed for the small dressing room next to the restroom. "I thought we'd go to lunch instead of working out."<br><br>Shannon already had her exercise clothes out of her gym bag. She turned back to Pam. "Not exercise?"<br><br>"Sure. We're the only two today. It's Friday, my friend. Live a little. Have a glass of wine, mock your uninformed banking friend and unwind."<br><br>Shannon looked at Nicole and raised her eyebrows. "I'm in," she said. "What about you?"<br><br>Nicole thought about her to-do list and the fact that she was behind on the laundry and had a stack of bills to pay and a husband who had walked away from a successful career in computer software to write a screenplay. She thought of the spinning and falling plates and how she spent her life exhausted.<br><br>She pulled the tie from her blond ponytail, shook her hair loose, grabbed her keys and her handbag and stood.<br><br>"Let's go."<br><br>McGrath's Pub had been around nearly as long as the Mischief Bay pier and boardwalk. Shannon remembered coming here when she'd been a teenager. The drive in from Riverside had taken about an hour, if there wasn't any traffic. She and her girlfriends had spent the whole time talking and laughing, imagining the cute boys they were going to meet. Boys who lived by the ocean and surfed and had sun-bleached hair. Boys not like those they knew in high school.<br><br>Because back then all it took to get her heart beating faster had been sun-bleached hair and a retro convertible.<br><br>She liked to think that in the past twenty-plus years she'd matured.<br><br>As she followed her friends into the pub, her gaze strayed to the sand and the ocean beyond. It was midday and low tide. No surfers out there now. As it was also a weekday in February, there weren't any people playing volleyball. Despite the fact that it was probably seventy degrees.<br><br>McGrath's was a three-story building with outdoor dining on the main level. Inside there was a big, open bar. Pam led the way directly to the stairs. They bypassed the second-floor dining room and went up to the top-floor eating area.<br><br>"By the window?" Pam asked, already heading in that direction.<br><br>The big windows offered a view of the Pacific. Today they were partially open, allowing in some fresh air. When temperatures dropped to anything below sixty-five they could be closed and in the summer, they were removed completely.<br><br>Shannon sat across from Nicole. Pam settled next to Nicole and put her tote on the floor next to her chair. The perfectly trained Lulu would stay hidden until they left.<br><br>The first time the three of them had played hooky and gone to lunch, Shannon had spent the entire time freaking out about Lulu. Now she saw the strange creature as the mascot for their friendship&#x2014;odd, unexpected and over time, very comforting.<br><br>She turned her attention from thoughts of a Chinese crested to the restaurant location. The view should have captured their attention and left them speechless. Taupe-colored sand led the way to midnight blue water. A couple of sailboats leaned in to capture the light breeze, and in the distance container ships chugged toward the horizon and the exotic ports beyond.<br><br>But this was L.A. and amazing views existed around every turn. Whether it was a star sighting at a Whole Foods or the lapping waters of the Pacific. Instead of talking about the beauty of the moment, Pam passed out menus.<br><br>"There's a burger special," Pam said with a sigh. "Did you see it? If I get that, will someone eat some of my fries?"<br><br>"I will," Nicole told her. "I get the protein plate here."<br><br>Pam wrinkled her nose. "Of course you do."<br><br>Shannon knew the protein plate consisted of broiled fish and shrimp with a side of steamed vegetables. Healthy, sure, but the low calorie count was of more concern to the body-conscious, bikini-clad locals.<br><br>"I'll have a couple of fries, too," she said. They would nicely round out the salad she generally ordered.<br><br>Pam poked Nicole in the upper arm. "You're a stick. You should eat more."<br><br>"I eat plenty."<br><br>"Roots and grubs. Have a burger." Pam leaned back in her chair. "Enjoy your metabolism while you can. Because one day, it's all going to hell."<br><br>"You look great," Nicole said easily. "You're in terrific shape."<br><br>Pam's brows rose. "If you say 'for a woman my age' I'm pitching you out the window."<br><br>Nicole laughed. "I'd never say that. You're nowhere near a certain age. That's old."<br><br>So spoke the thirty-year-old, Shannon thought wryly. Time was going faster and faster every day. She couldn't believe she was only a few months away from turning forty, herself. She glanced at Pam and Nicole's hands and saw the wedding bands and diamond engagement rings winking back at her. Not for the first time, Shannon considered the fact that somewhere along the way she should have gotten married.<br><br>She'd meant to, had always thought she would. Only her career had been her first priority&#x2014;a fact that the men she knew didn't like. The more successful she got, the harder it was to date. Or at least find a man who didn't resent her devotion to her career. Lately, finding someone interesting and appealing had started to seem nearly impossible.<br><br>She briefly toyed with the idea of mentioning that. All the articles she read said that she had to put herself out there if she wanted to meet a great guy. She had to be willing to tell all her friends that she was serious and looking. Of course, she had a sneaking suspicion that many articles in women's magazines were written by people who had no idea what they were talking about. Besides, she wasn't keen on pity. She was a successful, vital businesswoman. Hell, she was the chief financial officer of a company grossing more than a billion dollars a year. She didn't need a man in her life. Which wasn't to say she might not like having one around.<br><br>"How's my favorite young man?" Pam asked.<br><br>Nicole smiled. "Tyler is great.

She'd listened as Nicole had tried to explain her bewilderment that her stable, hard-working husband had quit his job to write a screenplay and surf.

Summoned back home to Sedona, Arizona, by the death of a childhood friend, she seeks solace in the comforting rhythms of her parents' diner, the Sugarloaf Caf�, and launches an on-line blog as therapy for others who have been similarly cut loose.</p><p>But when threatening posts begin appearing, Ali finds out that running a blog is far more up-close and personal&#x2014;and far more dangerous&#x2014;than sitting behind a news desk. Suddenly something dark and deadly is swirling around her life. And now Ali is a target...and marked for death.</p></p><p><p>J. A. Jance is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the J. P. Beaumont series, the Joanna Brady series, the Ali Reynolds series, and five interrelated thrillers about the Walker family, as well as a volume of poetry. Born in South Dakota and brought up in Bisbee, Arizona, Jance lives with her husband in Seattle, Washington, and Tucson, Arizona.</p>When Alison Reynolds is ousted from a television job in Los Angeles, she heads to Sedona, Arizona, to investigate the death of her closest friend. The police believe the friend committed suicide by driving off a mountain road, but Alison thinks it was murder. Susanna Burney expertly conveys the many emotions of the central characters, particularly Alison's anger as she fights for the truth of her friend's death. Burney also conveys a sense of place; the listener is drawn into the red rock scenery of northern Arizona. Some of the male voices sound adolescent, but that's a minor quibble. The tempo is right, the emotional tones convincing. Listeners will be captured and held.

This autobiography will encourage every Christian to trust in the Lord more and cry out to our ever living and hearing God in prayer for our needs and requests.</p><p>What can be accomplished in an ordinary man who trusts in an extraordinary God? George Mller discovered the endless possibilities!These excerpts from his diary allow Mller to tell his own story. Join him on his journey from a life of sin and rebellion to his glorious conversion. Share his struggles and triumphs as he establishes orphan homes to care for thousands of English children, depending on God&#39;s response to his prayer of faith to supply all things. You will learn how to:* pray in faith and receive answers* seek God for direction* find the ultimate purpose for your life* rest in God&#39;s loving careGeorge Mller&#39;s unwavering, childlike dependence upon his heavenly Father will inspire you to confidently trust the God of the impossible in every area of your life.George Mller was born in Kroppenstaedt, Prussia, on September 27, 1805. He was the son of a tax collector and, before he became a Christian, he had the reputation of a liar and a thief. After accepting Christ as his personal Savior, he was used in remarkable ways to provide for over 10,000 orphans during his lifetime. He never went into debt or asked anyone to supply his needs. He trusted in God to provide for him and for the orphans, and God never failed to do so. In 1834, he established the Scriptural Knowledge Institution for Home and Abroad. Its objectives were to: assist day schools and adult schools, where instruction was given based on scriptural principles; enable poor children to attend these day schools; circulate the Holy Scriptures; aid in supplying the needs of missionaries and missionary schools. The fifth objective, which was added later, was to provide for the needs of orphaned children. By the 1870s, God enabled George Mller to build five large orphanages on Ashley Down in Bristol, England, and to send 10,000 annually to nearly two hundred missionaries. In 1875, he began preaching tours that took him over 200,000 miles to 42 countries to preach to 3 million people. God transformed a little boy who stole from his earthly father into a man who could be trusted with the resources of his heavenly Father.The ministry of George Mller continues today through the establishment of the George Mller Foundation. Three charities operate under the direction of the Foundation: The Mller Homes for Children, the Mller Homes for the Elderly, and the Scriptural Knowledge Institution.

Elisabeth Schlossberg lives in France.PreS&#x2013;This book starts when Bear is a newborn. A page of rhyming couplets describes each year until NOW, the age of five, when the number of things the cub can do expands exponentially. Beginning with milestones such as riding a tricycle at age three or blowing bubbles at four, the list highlighting the childs growing independence and abilities quickly expands to include singing the ABCs, helping carry groceries, and putting on puppet shows. Most of the book is spent on these five-year-old skills, leading up to the first day of kindergarten, when readers turn the final page sideways to see a tall exuberant Bear, a baby no more!!!!! Whereas readers may not do all of the things this highly capable youngster can do, they will certainly identify with the joy and pride, evident on every page, that are a part of accomplishing something new. And with so many milestones included, most readers are bound to recognize themselves in some achievement. This sense of belonging is amplified by the friendly, cheerful art done in bright pastels. Bear is visibly happy, engaged, and supported by family and friends. A sidekick mouse in a ruffled orange dress lends added interest. This is a fun, celebratory story for any child just waiting to go to school.<i>&#x2013;Martha Topol, Traverse Area District Library, Traverse City, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She had heard the cruel and hateful words that had been spewed at women, those with disabilities, people of different faiths, and people of color. She had heard the talk aimed at &#x201c;taking our country back.&#x201d; Though she was only seven, some of that language of hate stayed with her. When she found out who the new president would be, she was frightened and confused, worried that the world as she knew it was in imminent danger. <br> We were so troubled. We knew there were thousands&#x2014;no, millions&#x2014;of young people like Jordyn, and perhaps, like you, too, who were fearful about the future. What could we tell you? we wondered. What words of comfort could we offer? How could we reach out to you the way others had reached out to us when we were your age and faced difficult challenges that seemed too big for us to handle? <br> So the idea for this treasury was born. Yes, we are living in challenging times, but we created this book so you will know that you are part of a community that loves you and can give you tools to help navigate the present and the future. <br> We grew up in the segregated South, when life for us was much different than it is today. Racial discrimination, prejudice, and hatred against African Americans were pervasive. We were prohibited from attending school with White children, so we went to all-Black schools. We couldn&#x2019;t go to the public library that Whites used. We were forced to sit in a &#x201c;special section&#x201d; in movie theaters. We couldn&#x2019;t even try on clothes or shoes from the stores downtown. Our parents had to purchase them, bring them home, and then see if they were a good fit. If they weren&#x2019;t, the items couldn&#x2019;t be returned. If there was no fountain designated &#x201c;Colored&#x201d; or &#x201c;Negro&#x201d; in the store, we had to wait until we got home to get a drink of water, or find another establishment that had a fountain for &#x201c;us.&#x201d; Our parents were not allowed to vote. <br> This segregated but unequal system we were forced to endure was extremely trying and often frightening. Yet, in our all-Black communities, we were embraced by accepting arms, motivated by encouraging words, and sheltered by watchful eyes that probed for signs of lurking dangers seeking to engulf us. We were loved! We knew it! We could feel it! <br> Today&#x2019;s challenges are different from those of the 1950s and 1960s. But we have valuable advice to share with you, nuggets of sustenance for you just as there were for us when we were your age. We invited children&#x2019;s book creators with diverse voices to share their perspectives, words and images of encouragement, and hope and love for you. These talented and thoughtful authors and illustrators have already been creating wonderful books with you in mind. <br> Within this collection, there&#x2019;s a letter from a parent to her children on kindness; there&#x2019;s advice on how to become confident and mindful; there are words of wisdom about finding and keeping friends; there are reminders of how to use the Golden Rule, how to cope with bullying, and how to face internal uncertainty; and there&#x2019;s an essay on how young people can change the world. <br> Challenges, some seemingly daunting, will come and go. There will be dark days, and days with bright, warm sunshine. There will be periods of hope, and periods of despair. But when the dark days come, you must remember how the sun shone brightly on your face. When despair looms, you must grasp on to hope and lift it high for all to see. That way, you can face the challenges, no matter what they are, with the determination and confidence necessary not only to endure, but to grow in spite of them. <br> This book is for you! To inspire you, motivate you, offer you love and hope, and encourage you to help make a difference.</p><h2>College (Un)bound: The Future of Higher Education and What It Means for Students</h2><p><p><i>What is the value of a college degree?</i></p><p>The four-year college experience is as American as apple pie. So is the belief that higher education offers a ticket to a better life. But with student-loan debt surpassing the $1 trillion mark and unemployment of college graduates at historic highs, people are beginning to question that value. </p><p>In <i>College (Un)bound</i>, Jeffrey J. Selingo, editor at large of the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, argues that America&#x2019;s higher education system is broken. The great credential race has turned universities into big business and fostered an environment where middle-tier colleges can command elite university-level tuition while concealing staggeringly low graduation rates, churning out graduates with few of the skills needed for a rapidly evolving job market.</p><p>Selingo not only turns a critical eye on the current state of higher education but also predicts how technology will transform it for the better. Free massive online open courses (MOOCs) and hybrid classes, adaptive learning software, and the unbundling of traditional degree credits will increase access to high-quality education regardless of budget or location and tailor lesson plans to individual needs. One thing is certain&#x2014;the Class of 2020 will have a radically different college experience than their parents.</p><p>Incisive, urgent, and controversial, <i>College (Un)bound</i> is a must-read for prospective students, parents, and anyone concerned with the future of American higher education.</p></p><p>Jeffrey J. Selingo is a leading authority on higher education worldwide and editor at large for the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>. He frequently speaks before national higher education groups and appears regularly on regional and national radio and television programs on NPR, PBS, ABC, MSNBC, and CBS. His writing has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, and the <i>Huffington Post. </i>INTRODUCTION <br>Bernardsville is an affluent village of nineteenth-century colonial homes, a small town center, and modern strip malls located in northern New Jersey, just thirty-five miles from midtown Manhattan. It&#x2019;s the type of American bedroom community where the college-educated settle, start families, watch their children grow up on the town ball fields, and then send them off to college after graduation from Bernards High School.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a rich selection of Advanced Placement courses and the exclusive two-year International Baccalaureate curriculum, the 750-student high school is often ranked among the best public schools in the state. In the fall of 2005, Samantha Dietz entered her senior year at Bernards. She was a member of the debate club, Harvard Model Congress, and worked for the student newspaper. She took Advanced Placement psychology, as well as several International Baccalaureate courses, including English, French, and environmental science. She maintained a 3.9 grade-point average. And like almost all of her senior class, she was bound for college the following fall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dietz would be the first in her family to go to college. Her parents had solid jobs in technology, despite having only high-school diplomas. They didn&#x2019;t push her to go to college, but Dietz&#x2019;s teachers and guidance counselors did, especially to four-year colleges. She applied to more than a half a dozen schools: Rutgers University, Drew University, Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey; Hofstra University in New York; and Allegheny College and Bucknell University in Pennsylvania. She was accepted to all but Bucknell, where she was put on the wait list.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When decision time came in the spring, Dietz closely examined the financial-aid offers from each of the colleges. For her, the choice would be strictly about the bottom line. Fairleigh Dickinson offered her the most financial aid, nearly all of it in grants that wouldn&#x2019;t have to be paid back. Its campus was about twenty minutes away, so she could live at home and save on room and board. With Fairleigh Dickinson&#x2019;s financial package, Dietz&#x2019;s tuition bill would be about half of the university&#x2019;s $25,000 list price at the time. Her decision was easy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Dietz failed to examine was Fairleigh Dickinson&#x2019;s graduation rate. In 2006, only 38 percent of its students graduated within six years, a rate well below all of the other schools she had considered. The two other local schools on her list, Rutgers and Drew, graduated more than 70 percent of their students within six years. Though Fairleigh Dickinson was giving Dietz a boatload of money, her chances of emerging at the other end with a degree were pretty dismal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dietz took a full slate of classes her first semester. To pay tuition, she waitressed and helped manage a restaurant near her house. She worked twenty-five hours a week, mostly on nights and weekends. &#x201c;By Thanksgiving, I was exhausted. I had no down time,&#x201d; she recalls. She was doing well in school, with mostly Bs in her classes. &#x201c;I felt like I was killing myself for nothing,&#x201d; Dietz says. &#x201c;This was money I could be saving and starting my life. I was managing a restaurant, handling finances and employees. I was learning a lot less about the real world in school and paying so much for it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the end of the semester, she received a letter from the university announcing that state funds to private colleges in New Jersey were at risk of being cut. It was a warning: she would likely need to pay even more the following fall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she dropped out of college. <br>The Dropout Crisis <br>The story of Samantha Dietz is not unique. It reflects a broad, national trend in American higher education, where some 400,000 students drop out every year.1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most of the twentieth century, the United States bragged that it had the best colleges and universities in the world &#x2014; and rightfully so. Since the end of World War II, when colleges and universities threw open their doors to returning GIs, helping to create a vast middle class that defined a generation, these institutions have been the envy of the world and a symbol of American greatness. They attracted the most talented students from other countries, and graduated young Americans who were the best educated in the world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not anymore. Over the last thirty years &#x2014; and particularly in the first decade of the new millennium &#x2014; American higher education has lost its way. At the very top, the most elite and prestigious institutions remain the best &#x2014; the world still clamors to get into Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Berkeley, Stanford, Amherst, Williams, and a few dozen other household brands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the colleges and universities attended by most American students, costs are spiraling out of control and quality is declining just as increasing international competition demands that higher education be more productive and less expensive. Only slightly more than 50 percent of American students who enter college leave with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree. Among wealthy countries, only Italy ranks lower. As a result, the United States is now ranked number twelve among developed nations in higher-education attainment by its young people.2 As the baby boomer generation leaves the work force, the country risks having successive generations less educated than the ones that preceded them for the first time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such trends carry significant economic risks for the United States. For every dollar earned by college graduates, those who drop out without a degree earn sixty-seven cents. Since the turn of the century, average wages for high-school graduates &#x2014; who today make up about half of the adult population &#x2014; have fallen considerably to just over $19,000, below the federal poverty level for a family of four. Nothing short of winning the lottery helps ensure a young person will achieve the American dream quite like a college degree. A four-year college credential is the best ticket &#x2014; and perhaps the only ticket &#x2014; for kids from the poorest families to get ahead. For children from families at higher income levels (defined as $61,000 and above), a degree helps them make it to the top themselves. &nbsp; In 2010, four years after Dietz quit Fairleigh Dickinson, she signed up for a class at nearby Raritan Valley Community College. Since then, she has taken one class a semester, paying about $500 a course. She wishes her counselors in high school had encouraged her to consider community college, instead of mocking two-year institutions as places for students who couldn&#x2019;t hack it on a four-year campus.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Dietz is twenty-four years old and working for a real estate company. Her job doesn&#x2019;t require a degree, but she thinks she&#x2019;ll eventually get one. She has heard the statistics on the long-term payoff of a degree, but for the moment Dietz feels she is better off than many of her high-school friends who went to college. &#x201c;They graduated and are in worse situations,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;They are back to waitressing or nannying, not doing anything with their degree. They are living at home and in tons of debt. I&#x2019;m in a much better situation.&#x201d; <br><b>A Risk-Averse, Self-Satisfied Industry</b> <br>American higher education is broken.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like another American icon &#x2014; the auto industry in Detroit &#x2014; the higher-education industry is beset by hubris, opposition to change, and resistance to accountability. Even the leaders of colleges and universities think we&#x2019;re in trouble. More than one-third of them say American higher education is headed in the wrong direction.3<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, in its final report from a year-long study, a federal commission studying the future of higher education warned of the dangers of complacency. &#x201c;What we have learned over the last year makes clear that American higher education has become what, in the business world, would be called a mature enterprise: increasingly risk-averse, at times self-satisfied, and unduly expensive,&#x201d; it said. &#x201c;History is littered with examples of industries that, at their peril, failed to respond to &#x2014; or even to notice &#x2014; changes in the world around them, from railroads to steel manufacturers.&#x201d;4<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change comes very slowly to higher education. Many institutions in the United States were established over two centuries ago, with a handful dating back to the days before the American Revolution. Tradition is important at these colleges. A confluence of events &#x2014; flagging state support for public colleges, huge federal budget deficits, and falling household income &#x2014; now makes it necessary to consider new approaches.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideas for change are everywhere. Almost every day a report about innovation in higher education or an invitation to a meeting about its future lands on my desk. In April 2012, I made my way to one of the largest of those gatherings, the Education Innovation Summit at Arizona State University.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summit was notable for who wasn&#x2019;t there. As I scanned the name tags of the 800 or so attendees, I found very few were actual educators &#x2014; the college presidents, professors, or others who spend their days on campuses immersed in the business of higher education.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gathering at an office park for start-ups run by Arizona State had attracted educational entrepreneurs, CEOs, and investors to hear talks about the future of education and see demonstrations from more than a hundred companies promising to bring massive change to the tradition-bound industry.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kicking off the meeting with a call to arms was Michael Crow, the hard-charging leader who, in his ten years as president, had transformed Arizona State from a sleepy public university to a test bed for new ideas. Lecturing the group on what ails higher education, he summed up its problems in a word most of us had never heard &#x2014; filiopietism. Translation: higher education is clinging to tradition. Too few students are going to college, not enough are graduating, and the whole thing costs too much. Quoting his father, a US Navy sailor, Crow called this a &#x201c;piss-poor performance.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Crow is derided in some academic circles for his business-like approach to higher education, he found a sympathetic audience in this gathering. For this crowd, lacking an academic pedigree is exactly what&#x2019;s needed to reform the outdated methods of traditional colleges, and of course, profit at the same time. Investors are lining up to cash in on the college of tomorrow. Venture capitalists poured some $429 million into education companies in 2011. That same year, in the midst of a worldwide economic slump, 124 education start-ups received financial backing, the most since 1999 during the height of the dot-com boom.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new business ideas that are changing higher education range from rethinking how high-school students apply to college (think Facebook, with colleges making friend requests to prospective applicants), to how courses are delivered (150,000 students in an online class), to how learners are certified (think of a badge like those given in the Boy Scouts, instead of a diploma). Each new idea raises the anxiety level of administrators on traditional college campuses that have had a monopoly on the credential market and want to maintain it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other industries, &#x201c;those who don&#x2019;t innovate go out of business,&#x201d; Jennifer Fremont-Smith tells me under the ninety-degree Scottsdale sun during a break in the program. She is cofounder of Smarterer, a Boston-based start-up that offers technology for validating technical skills on everything from social media to Microsoft Office programs. &#x201c;Higher ed,&#x201d; she adds, &#x201c;shouldn&#x2019;t be different.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the technological advances of the past two decades, the revolution in the way college education is delivered is just beginning. For the most part, the residential college experience of today is much like it was ten or twenty years ago &#x2014; the classrooms, dorms, dining halls, and quad. Though laptops and iPads are ubiquitous in lecture halls, students can take classes online, the dining halls have sushi, and nearly everyone has a smartphone, the basics of going to college and getting a broad education or training in a profession remain largely unchanged.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least for now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A college has many purposes, from research and discovery to maturing students. At its core, one of the purposes is information delivery, and in recent years other long-established content providers from music to journalism to books have been transformed by technology, resulting in the decline of the middleman &#x2014; record stores, newspapers, bookstores, and publishers. Are colleges next? Talk of a coming disruption to the traditional college model has reached a fever pitch in some corners of higher education &#x2014; each day seems to bring news of innovations with the potential to transform how we get a college degree, just as iTunes forever changed how we buy music.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If every revolution has a turning point, perhaps that defining moment came for higher education in the fall of 2011. A Stanford professor, Sebastian Thrun, and Google&#x2019;s Director of Research, Peter Norvig, offered their graduate-level artificial intelligence course online for free. They thought the class might appeal to 500 students, perhaps a thousand. It ended up attracting 160,000 students from 190 countries, prompting the label &#x201c;Massive Online Open Course,&#x201d; or MOOC. The 22,000 students who finished received an official &#x201c;Statement of Accomplishment.&#x201d; Thrun then asked the top thousand students who had perfect or near-perfect scores on their assignments to send him their r�sum�s. He promised to pass the best ones on to tech companies throughout Silicon Valley. After the course ended, Thrun turned his focus to a company he started, Udacity, which offers low-cost, online classes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the Stanford class touched off a string of announcements in the following months by MIT, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Michigan, Princeton University, and dozens of others that they would attempt to deliver a piece of their brand-name education to the masses online. At the same time, new ideas to substantially lower the cost of a traditional college degree were emerging. The most notable effort was at the University of North Texas. There leaders called in the management consulting firm, Bain &amp; Company, famous for helping corporate America restructure its operations, to assist the university in designing the college of the future for its branch campus in Dallas. The model shaped by Bain called for a limited number of majors tied to the needs of the local economy (such as business and information technology), classes offered year-round, and hybrid courses (a combination of online and face-to-face classes). For students who graduate on time, a bachelor&#x2019;s degree would cost about $18,000.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new University of North Texas campus and massive online courses like Thrun&#x2019;s are precisely the type of disruptive forces that Clay Christensen envisions displacing traditional players i...</p><h2>Frog Trouble: . . .

Since 1974, Boynton has written and illustrated over sixty children&#39;s books and seven general audience books, including five New York Times bestsellers. More than 70 million of her books have been sold, &#34;mostly to friends and family,&#34; she says. She has also written (with Michael Ford) and produced six albums of renegade children&#39;s music. Three of her albums have been certified Gold (over 500,000 copies sold), and Philadelphia Chickens, nominated for a Grammy, has gone Platinum (over 1 million copies sold). Boynton has also directed twelve music videos of her songs, including the award-winning &#34;One Shoe Blues&#34; starring B.B. King, &#34;Alligator Stroll&#34; starring Josh Turner, and &#34;Tyrannosaurus Funk&#34; (animation) sung by Samuel L. Jackson. She lives in rural New England, and her studio is in a barn with perhaps the only hippopotamus weathervane in America.Combining Boynton&#x2019;s lyrics and music with the voices and instruments of today&#x2019;s top country musicians results in a heck of a fun half hour of country music at its best. Now, these aren&#x2019;t your typical chart-topping tunes about unrequited love, but rather entertaining songs about frogs, dogs, trucks, and more. Fitting the style of country music, each song tells a story&#x2014;some sad, some funny, and some just sweet. The simple lines and muted colors of Boynton&#x2019;s clean, uncluttered illustrations further expand the tone of the songs. The book is divided into three parts: &#x201c;Look While You Listen,&#x201d; &#x201c;Sing and Play Along,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Meet the Performers.&#x201d; In the first are the lyrics and art; in the second are the lyrics and the music (just the melody); and in the third are photos of the singers, bands, and instrumentalists, followed by recording credits, book credits, and lastly, instructions for making a folding frog puppet. Naturally, this comes with a CD. Get some scratch guard, because it&#x2019;ll be played a lot. Grades K-3. --J. B.

Encouraging individuals to focus on their own personal intelligence and integrity rather than simply navigating the rules and incentives established by others, <i>Practical Wisdom</i> outlines how to identify and cultivate our own innate wisdom in our daily lives.</p></p><p>Barry Schwartz is the author of the acclaimed bestseller <i>The Paradox of Choice</i>.

Kenan, Jr. Professor of Political Science at Swarthmore College where he teaches political philosophy, ethics, and political economy. His most recent book is <i>Drug War Politics: The Price of Denial</i>.In this thoughtful consideration of an Aristotelian ideal, Schwartz and Sharpe delve deeply into what it means to practice wisdom. What makes this an engrossing (and socially significant) read is not the nod to the ancient Greeks but, rather, the numerous examples of people in all facets of American life who seek wisdom in their professional and personal choices. The authors consider how mandatory sentencing has removed the element of judgment from a judge&#x2019;s position, citing a heartbreaking example. As they further make the case for empathy and patience, they delve into health care, education, and the groundbreaking work being conducted in the extraordinarily successful Veterans Court in Buffalo. Repeatedly, by example, they stress the necessity of a human approach, without politics, to the issues of how we live and interact with each other. And through all of this, Schwartz and Sharpe demonstrate how relevant Aristotle is today. As surprising as it is convincing, this thoughtful work will long stay with readers, as will the many people who are profiled on its pages. --Colleen Mondor</p><h2>Realistic Turtles Stickers (Dover Little Activity Books Stickers)</h2><p>Sixteen accurately rendered full-color stickers depict painted and snapping turtles, red-eared slider, desert tortoise, Matamata turtle, hawksbill, loggerhead, green sea turtle, and 8 more.

It is written by a licensed distiller who started his own distillery and then operated it successfully for almost twenty years. The book&#x2019;s focus is on the actual mechanical, biological and chemical aspects of operating a distillery as well as the regulatory requirements associated with being in such a highly regulated business. The book is not highly technical but is written on a professional level as a peer to peer work for other distillers. Alcohol aficionado&#x2019;s who want to learn how alcohol is actually fermented, distilled, rectified and bottled will also learn a great deal from the text. While there is a great deal of text and explanation of the processes involved, much of the work is explained in tables that show the results of various operations, like just how big a still do you need to produce 100 gallons of alcohol a day; and how much corn do you really have to purchase to make that 100 gallons, down to how many yeast do you need to ferment it and how much energy do you need to apply in order to distill it. The book provides a good survey of the processes necessary to produce quality beverage grade alcohol on a commercial but still artisanal scale. The later parts of the work are devoted to the author&#x2019;s experiences and conclusions about the distilling business.</p><p>Payton Fireman is an attorney by trade and has practiced law in West Virginia for thirty years.

His story begins at the end of the world: Dallas, New Year's Eve 1999, when he gathers with the congregation of his grandfather's black evangelical church to see which of them will be carried off. His beautiful, fragile mother disappears frequently and mysteriously; for a brief idyll, he and his sister live like Boxcar Children on her disability checks. When Casey--following in the footsteps of his father, a gridiron legend who literally broke his back for the team--is recruited to play football at Yale, he enters a world he's never dreamed of, the anteroom to secret societies and success on Wall Street, in Washington, and beyond. But even as he attains the inner sanctums of power, Casey sees how the world crushes those who live at its margins. He sees how the elite perpetuate the salvation stories that keep others from rising. And he sees, most painfully, how his own ascension is part of the scheme. <br><br><i>There Will Be No Miracles Here</i> has the arc of a classic rags-to-riches tale, but it stands the American Dream narrative on its head. If to live as we are is destroying us, it asks, what would it mean to truly live? Intense, incantatory, shot through with sly humor and quiet fury,<i> There Will Be No Miracles Here</i> inspires us to question--even shatter--and reimagine our most cherished myths.</p><p><b>Casey Gerald</b> grew up in Oak Cliff, Texas and went to Yale, where he majored in political science and played varsity football.

Mnemosyne Books.</p><p>Louisa May Alcott (November 29, 1832 &#x2013; March 6, 1888) was an American novelist and poet best known as the author of the novel Little Women (1868) and its sequels Little Men (1871) and Jo's Boys (1886).</p><h2>The Way To Live: In Health and Physical Fitness (Original Version, Restored)</h2><p>&#34;Some trainers recommend to their pupils for the training of all muscle groups one and the same (light) weight and believe they are able to obtain the same effect by frequent repetitions. My experience has taught me that this is wrong, for the muscles of men or animals who are distinguished for certain feats of endurance are by no means over-developed. A long-distance runner or long-distance cyclist always has comparatively thin legs, as have a racehorse, stag, or greyhound. Nature does not act without aim and purpose. Hence there is a great difference between feats of endurance and feats of strength. One must consider that, although it is quite possible to enlarge muscles by certain light, prolonged exercises, at the same time the development of the sinews may be neglected, and it is the sinews which transport the action of the muscles to the bone xframe. The sinews can only be exercised and strengthened by correspondingly heavy muscle work. Besides, to take a paradoxical example, it is quite impossible to improve strong muscle groups, as, for instance, the hip muscles, with light-weight exercises. A further illustration of the fallacy of attempting to develop the muscles by frequent repetitions with the same light exercises may be found in a comparison with any and every other form of athletics, in which a man would never think of merely repeating his training programme. In order to improve himself either in pace or distance, he must set himself a steady progression of arduous effort&#34;. - George Hackenschmidt This is an original version, restored and re-formatted edition of Hackenschmidt&#39;s 1908 classic. Visit our website and see our many books at PhysicalCultureBooks.com</p><p>George Hackenschmidt: The Russian Lion - &#34;Back in an age when ... few if any Far Eastern Masters of Martial arts were known to the rest of the World. ... One man in particular, a master of his own most ancient fighting skill, ... possessed the same qualities ... to be recognized {by} Japanese/Chinese martial arts masters ... He had the total formula for combat domination, winning over 3000 bouts between 1889 and 1908. That man, George Hackenschmidt was destined to become famous throughout the World and take his place in fighting arts history as THE RUSSIAN LION and unlike many of his opponents and contempary wrestlers, &#39;Hack&#39; was never mean, vindictive or unnecessarily rough in his wrestling bouts, contrasting his physical prowess and fighting skills with a quietness of spirit. George Hackenschmidt was the epitome of calm, self-assurance and inner peace, with full awareness of his own capabilities and thus like all masters of combat found NO NEED FOR MACHOISM or outward aggression. His tactic to win was skill and speed, born of confidence in his own ability and fighting prowess. He spoke softly, so that you were forced to listen and pay attention, rather than raise his voice to be heard. His serenity was &#39;catching&#39;, calming all those in attendance at his lectures...and it was a developed calmness. A true warrior has to struggle and EARN the wisdom to do battle, with not only his adversities, but with LIFE ITSELF. Of German/Swedish descent,(which accounts for his un Russian name) the fighting legend Georges Karl Julius Hackenschmidt (aka Hack or The Russian Lion) was born 2nd August 1878, or using the older style Russian calendar July 20th 1872, at Dorpat in Estonia. Genetically favored from his grandfather&#39;s physique, he soon excelled at gymnastics, athletics and weight lifting.

The designs are monograms of and symbols for our Lord Jesus Christ. Because these designs have been used by his followers since biblical times, they are the heritage of all Christians and serve to remind each of us regardless of denomination of the One we follow. All Chrismons&#x2122; ornaments are made in a combination of white and gold to symbolize the purity and majesty of the Son of God and the Son of Man. The Basic Series includes basic Christian theological symbols in bead work and styrofoam</p><p>Frances Kipps Spencer was the daughter of the Rev. Michael M. and Mrs. Undine H. Kipps who spent time as missionaries in China. Mrs. Spencer inherited her mother's imagination and her father's attention to detail. After several years of making her own ornaments and perfecting her techniques, she set out to solve the problem of a Christmas Tree in a church that seems to no belong. The result was an inspired version of decoration honoring the holiness of Christ and telling the story of him ministry. The Chrismons&#x2122; Tree tradition has continued at Ascension Lutheran Church for over fifty years. Mrs. Spencer stated a tree was never finished until someone came to see it and have the story of Christ explained to them through the ornaments. Today the original ornaments are joined by gifts from around the globe. The tree is available for viewing from Mid-December through Christmas Eve with live interpreters on site to explain the tree. Groups are welcome to schedule a day-time visit by contacting the Chrismon Secretary.

Because nothing has been the same since it happened&#x2015;not marriages, not friendships, not even the relationships between parents and children. <br>Kevin Garvey, Mapleton's new mayor, wants to speed up the healing process, to bring a sense of renewed hope and purpose to his traumatized community. Kevin's own family has fallen apart in the wake of the disaster: his wife, Laurie, has left to join the Guilty Remnant, a homegrown cult whose members take a vow of silence; his son, Tom, is gone, too, dropping out of college to follow a sketchy prophet named Holy Wayne.

In <i>The Leftovers</i> he explores what would happen if The Rapture actually took place and millions of people just disappeared from the earth. How would normal people respond? Perrotta&#x2019;s characters show a variety of coping techniques, including indifference, avoidance, depression, freaking out, and the joining of cults. Despite the exceptional circumstances, it&#x2019;s really not unlike how people respond to more minor incidents in their lives (excepting cults). The result is a novel that&#x2019;s a slow burn yet strangely compelling, one that leaves the reader pondering the story long after it&#x2019;s over. In vivid and occasionally satiric prose, he takes a bizarre and abnormal event--the Rapture--and imagines how normal people would deal with being left behind. <i>--Chris Schluep</i></p>TOM PERROTTA is the author of several works of fiction, including <i>The</i> <i>Wishbones</i> and <i>Joe College</i>. His novels <i>Election</i> and <i>Little Children</i> were made into acclaimed and award-winning movies.

Although the authors came from different backgrounds, there is one message, one theme, one thread that runs throughout the entire Bible from the first book, Genesis, to the last book, Revelation. That message is God&#x2019;s redeeming love for mankind&#x2014;a message that is as relevant for us today as it was two thousand years ago.In The Kingdom Books, we will see that God is a Promise Keeper. He had indeed given His people the land He had promised them, but the land was under the control of the Canaanites. The land was rich and fertile, but the inhabitants were fierce, experienced warriors. It would have been an impossible mission had not the God of the universe, the all-powerful One, been on their side.Those entering the Promised Land were the children of those who had left Egypt; therefore, many of them had only heard of God&#x2019;s faithfulness as He led their parents through the wilderness to the Promised Land. Yet through Moses&#x2019; capable leadership, they were strong in their faith and determined to obey the living God and establish aland and a nation that would be a blessing to all the earth. So, with their confidence in Yahweh, the Israelites began the march into the land God had given them.The Kingdom Books (Joshua, Judges, Ruth, First Samuel, Second Samuel, First Kings, and Second Kings) include the conquering of the land, the ruling of the judges, and the uniting and the dividing of the kingdom. These books end with Israel conquered and scattered and Judah destroyed and exiled.</p><p>God&#x2019;s Amazing Word. Learn it. Live it. Have it for Life.

Born in the mid-fourteenth century, Katherine de Ro�t was only twelve when she married Hugh Swynford, an impoverished knight. But her story had truly begun two years earlier, when she was appointed governess to the household of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and fourth son of King Edward III. Widowed at twenty-one, Katherine became John's mistress and then, after many twists of fortune, his bride in a scandalous marriage. Mistress of the Monarchy reveals a woman ahead of her time&#x2014;making her own choices, flouting convention, and taking control of her own destiny. Indeed, without Katherine Swynford, the course of English history, perhaps even the world, would have been very different.</p><p>Alison Weir is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the novels<b> Innocent Traitor</b> and <b>The Lady Elizabeth</b> and several historical biographies, including <b>Mistress of the Monarchy, Queen Isabella, Henry VIII, Eleanor of Aquitaine, The Life of Elizabeth I</b>, and <b>The Six Wives of Henry VIII</b>. She lives in Surrey, England with her husband and two children.<i>Chapter One<br><br>Panetto's Daughter<br><br></i>Katherine Swynford, that famous adulteress,1 was set on the path to notoriety, fame, and a great love at the tender age of two or thereabouts, when she was placed in the household of Philippa of Hainault, wife to Edward III of England. This would have been around 1352, and Katherine's disposition with the popular and maternal Philippa was almost certainly due to her father, Sir Paon de Ro�t, having rendered years of faithful service to the Queen and the royal family of Hainault.<br><br>Like her benefactress, Katherine was a Hainaulter. She was born Katherine de Ro�t, her surname variously given as Rouet, Ro�lt, or Ruet, and pronounced Roay. The Ro�ts were a prominent family in Hainault, then an independent principality located in the western reaches of the Holy Roman Empire, bordering on the kingdom of France and occupying much of what is now Belgium. This fertile and prosperous county stretched from Li�ge and Brussels in the north to Lille and Valenciennes in the south, and contained other thriving cloth cities: Mons, Charleroi, and Tournai; all of which provided a market for England's raw wool, her chief export. Formed at the time of the division of Charlemagne's empire in the ninth century, Hainault had been an imperial fief since 1071, and in the early fourteenth century it was ruled by the House of Avesnes, which had come to power in 1244.<br><br>Katherine possibly had noble or even royal connections through her mother, but claims that she was closely related through her father to the aristocratic lords of Roeulx cannot be substantiated. The Roeulx were a great and powerful Hainaulter family that could trace its descent from the ancient counts of Flanders and Hainault, who were themselves descended from the Emperor Charlemagne, and from England's famous King Alfred. William the Conqueror had married a princess of that house, Matilda of Flanders, and by her was the founder of the ruling dynasties of England, the Norman and Plantagenet kings. Since the twelfth century the lords of Roeulx had prospered mightily.2 Their landholdings centered mainly on the town of Le Roeulx, which lies eight miles northeast of Mons, but their name is also associated with Roux, forty miles east of Mons, and Fauroeulx, twenty miles to the south.<br><br>That Katherine shared a close kinship with the lords of Roeulx is doubtful on heraldic evidence alone&#x2014;or the lack of it.3 Her family was relatively humble. The chronicler Jean Froissart, a native of Hainault, who appears to have been quite well informed on Katherine Swynford's background, states that Jean de Ro�t, who died in 1305 and was the son of one Huon de Ro�t, was her grandfather. Neither bore a title. Yet it is possible that there was some blood tie with the Roeulx. Paon de Ro�t, the father of Katherine Swynford, whose name appears in English sources as Payn or Payne,4 and is pronounced Pan,was almost certainly baptized Gilles, a name borne by several members of the senior line of the Roeulx, which is one reason some historians have linked him to this branch of the family.5 Of course, the similarity in surnames suggests a connection in that period, the spellings of Roeulx and Ro�t could be, and were, interchangeable as does the fact that both families are known to have had connections with the area around<br>Mons and Le Roeulx. But discrepancies in arms would appear to indicate that Paon was at best a member of a junior branch of the House of Roeulx; all the same, it is possible that the royal blood of Charlemagne and Alfred the Great did indeed run in Katherine's veins.<br><br>The arms of the town of Le Roeulx were a silver lion on a green field holding a wheel in its paw;6 this is a play on words, for wheel in French is <i>roue, </i>which is similar to, and symbolic of, Roeulx. It was a theme adopted by Paon's own family: His arms were three plain silver wheels on a field of red; they were not the spiked- gold Katherine wheels later used by his daughter.7 On the evidence of heraldic emblems on the vestments given by her to Lincoln Cathedral, Katherine Swynford used not only her familiar device of Katherine wheels, which she adopted after 1396, but also her father's device of three plain silver wheels.8<br><br>If Jean de Ro�t was his father, as seems likely, then Gilles alias Paon was born by 1305&#x2013;06 at the very latest. Thus he did not marry and father children until comparatively late in life. The references in the <i>Cartulaire des Comtes de Hainaut </i>to Gilles de Ro�t called Paon or Paonnet imply that the name Paon was almost certainly a nickname, although it was the name by<br>which Gilles became customarily known, and it even appeared on his tomb memorial. In French, <i>paon </i>means peacock,which suggests that Paon was a vain man who liked dressing in brightly colored, fashionable clothes, possibly in order to impress the ladies. However, in the form <i>pion, </i>it means usher,9 a term that may be descriptive of Paon's duties at court.10<br><br>John of Gaunt's epitaph states that Katherine came from a knightly family,and Paon's knighthood is attested to by several sources,11 although we do not know when he received the accolade. In 1349 he is even referred to as a lord, and his daughter Elizabeth as noble,12 which reflects his landed status and probably his links to aristocratic blood. This is also evident in his<br>ability to place his children with royalty,13 which suggestsin the case of his daughters, at leastthat there was the prospect of some inheritance that would ensure they made good marriages.14 We know Paon held land in Hainault, because in 1411 his grandson, Sir Thomas Swynford, Katherine's son, was to pursue his claim to lands he had inherited there from his mother.15 Paon is unlikely, however, to have owned a large estate and was probably not a wealthy man16 since he was to rely heavily on royal patronage to provide for his children's future.<br><br>Paon had first come to England in December 1327 in the train of Philippa of Hainault, who married the young King Edward III on January 24, 1328, in York Minster. Paon perhaps served as Philippa's usher, and may have been present in that capacity at the royal wedding, which took place in the as yet unroofed minster in the midst of a snowstorm.<br><br>After Philippa's nuptial celebrations had ended, nearly all her Hainaulter servants were sent home. Apart from a handful of ladies, only Paon de Ro�t and Walter de Mauney, her carving squire, are known to have been allowed to remain in her retinue,17 a mark of signal royal favor, which suggests that Paon was highly regarded by both the young king and queen, and was perhaps a kinsman of Philippa, possibly through their shared ancestry.<br><br>That kinship may also have been established, or reinforced, through marriage. No one has as yet successfully identified Katherine's mother, for the name of Paon's wife is not recorded in contemporary documents. The slender evidence we have suggests he perhaps married more than once, that his first marriage took place before ca. 1335, and that his four known children,<br>who were born over a period of about fifteen years or more, may have been two sets of half siblings; in which case Katherine was the child of a second wife, whom he possibly married in the mid late 1340s. We know he maintained links with Hainault, probably through the good offices of Queen Philippa and other members of her house, so it may be that at least one of his wives was a Hainaulter.18<br><br>It is also possible that Katherine's mother herself was related to the ruling family of Hainault,19 and while this theory cannot be proved, it is credible in many respects. If Paon was linked by marriage, as well as by blood, to Queen Philippa, that would further explain his continuing links with the House of Avesnes and the trust in which he and his family were held by the ruling families of England and Hainault. It would explain too why all his children received royal patronage and why Queen Philippa took such an interest in them; and it was possibly one reason why John of Gaunt may have felt it was appropriate to ultimately marry one of them.<br><br>But there is unlikely to have been a close blood tie.20 If Paon' s wife was related to the House of Avesnes, it must have been through a junior branch or connection. Had the kinship been closer, we would expect Paon to have enjoyed more prominence in the courts of England and Hainault. There have, of course, been other unsubstantiated theories as to who Katherine's mother could have been,21 but this is the most convincing.<br><br>Whether Paon was related by marriage to Queen Philippa or not, he was evidently held in high regard by her, and he played his part in the early conflicts of the Hundred Years War, which broke out in 1340 after Edward III claimed the throne of France. For a time Paon served Queen Philippa as Master of the House,22 and in 1332 there is a record of her giving money to Panetto de Ro�t de Hanonia";23 this is the earliest surviving reference to him. His lost epitaph in Old St. Paul's Cathedral describes him as Guienne King of Arms,24 and it may have been through Philippa's influence that he was appointed to this office in ca. 1334,25 Guienne being part of the Duchy of Aquitaine and a fief of the English Crown.<br><br>By the mid- 1340s, Paon was back in Queen Philippa's service as one of the chevaliers of the noble and good Queen.26 In 1346 he fought at Cr�cy under Edward III. That same year, Sir Panetto de Ro�t" was present at the siege of Calais, and in August 1347 he was Marshal of the<br>Queen's Household, and one of two of her knights&#x2014;the other was Sir Walter de Mauney assigned to conduct to her chamber the six burghers who had given themselves up as hostages after Calais fell to Edward III, and whose lives had been spared thanks to the Queen's intercession.27<br><br>Philippa, however, never courted criticism by indiscriminately promoting her compatriots, which may explain why Paon, although well thought of and loved by the Queen because he was her countryman,28 never came to greater prominence at the English court29 and why he eventually sought preferment elsewhere.<br><br>By 1349, the year the Black Death was decimating the population of England and much of Europe, Paon had apparently returned to Hainault. From that year on, there are several references to him in the contemporary <i>Cartulaire des Comtes de Hainaut, </i>the official record of service of the counts of Hainault.30 The first reference concerns a noble adolescent, Elizabeth de Ro�t, daughter of my lord Gilles, called Paonnet, de Ro�t,who, sometime after July 27, 1349, was nominated as a prebendary, or honorary canoness (<i>chanoinness</i>),31 of the chapter of the Abbey of St. Waudru in Mons by Queen Philippa's elder sister, Margaret, sovereign Countess of Hainault and Empress of Germany. The choice of a convent in Mons, so close to the former Roeulx estates, reinforces the theory that Paon was connected to that family and that his lands were located in this area.<br><br>Girls were not normally accepted into the novitiate before the age of thirteen, so Elizabeth de Ro�t, who was described as being adolescent at the time of her placement, was probably born around 1335-36 at the latest. St. Waudru was a prestigious and influential abbey, and it was an honor for a girl to be so placed by Countess Margaret; it further demonstrates the close ties between the Ro�ts and the ruling family of Hainault, and suggests yet again a familial link between them. It was unusual for the eldest girl of a gentle family to enter the cloister, but given the fact that Paon's daughters were both to offer their own daughters as nuns, we might conclude that giving a female child to God was a Ro�t family custom.<br><br>Paon also had a son, Walter de Ro�t, possibly named after Sir Walter de Mauney,32 who in 1355-56 was in the service, in turn, of Countess Margaret and her son, Duke Albert, and Edward III's eldest son and heir, Edward of Woodstock, Prince of Wales, popularly known to history as the Black Prince.As Walter was a Yeoman of the Chamber to the Prince in 1355, and<br>probably fought under his command at Poitiers in 1356, he is likely to have been born no later than 1338-40.<br><br>Between 1350 and 1352 there are seven references to Paon in the <i>Cartulaire des Comtes de Hainaut. </i>For example, on May 11, 1350, he is recorded as preparing to accompany Countess Margaret's sons Duke Albert, Duke William, and Duke Otto on a pilgrimage to the church of St. Martin at Sebourg near Valenciennes to make their devotions at the shrine of the twelfth- century hermit, St. Druon. It was probably in that year that Paon's famous daughter was born.<br><br>C.L. Kingsford, in his article on Katherine Swynford in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography, </i>suggested that she was born in 1350. There is no contemporary record of her date of birth, but since the minimum canonical age at which a girl could be married and have marital intercourse was twelve, and Katherine probably married around 1362-63 and had her first child ca. 1363-64, a date of 1350 is feasible, although she could have been born a little earlier. November 25 is the feast day of St. Katherine, so it is possible that Paon's second daughter was named for the patron saint on whose anniversary she was born, and for whom she was to express great devotion and reverence.<br><br>In the Middle Ages, St. Katherine of Alexandria was one of the most popular of female saints. Edward III and Philippa of Hainault had a special devotion to her; their accounts show that Katherine wheels, the symbol of her martydom, adorned counterpanes on the royal beds, jousting apparel, and other garments. Like other English medieval queens, Philippa was patroness of the royal hospital of St. Katherine- by- the- Tower in London, which had recently been rebuilt under her auspices, and with which Katherine Swynford herself would one day be associated.33<br><br>St. Katherine probably never even existed. There is no record of her in antiquity, and her cult did not emerge until the ninth century. She was said to have been of patrician or even royal birth, beautiful, rich, respected, and learned. Her studies led her to convert to Christianity at a time when Christians were being persecuted in the Roman Empire, and she dared to publicly protest to the Emperor Maxentius (reigned AD 306-312) against the worship of pagan idols and the persecution itself. Maxentius was greatly impressed by her beauty and her courage in adhering to her convictions, and sent fifty of his sages and philosophers to reason with her. When they failed to demolish her arguments, he was so infuriated that he had them all burned alive. He then demanded that Katherine abjure her Christian faith and marry him, but she refused on the grounds that she was a bride of Christ. At this, the emperor's patience with her gave out, and she was beaten, imprisoned, and sentenced to be broken on a spiked wheel that had its two halves rotating in different directions. But just as her agony was about to begin, an angel appeared and smote the wheel with a sword, breaking it into pieces.<br><br>This miraculous intervention is said to have inspired the mass conversion of two thousand Roman soldiers, whereupon an even more enraged Maxentius had Katherine beheaded. Afterward, other angels appeared and miraculously carried her remains to Mount Sinai, where a Greek Orthodox monastery was built to house her shrine. It should be noted that there are<br>many variations on this fantastical tale.<br><br>Throughout the Middle Ages the cult of St. Katherine gained momentum. She was revered for her staunch faith, her courage, and her blessed virginity, and was believed to have under her special protection young maidens, churchmen, philosophers, students, craftsmen, nurses, and the dying.

Every word of it is true. For fear of losing my job and damage to my reputation in the legal community, I kept a secret. I was silent for forty years until circumstances in 2012 compelled me to eventually speak out. In 1977, a friend and I went on a two-night camping trip to a state park known as Devils Den. We had planned the trip as a wilderness adventure. Instead of a wilderness adventure we experienced an encounter with something unknown and unimaginable. Hoping to photograph eagles we sought a remote area of high ground. With the road no more than a trail we came to a high plateau. It was the perfect location with the forest to our back and a large open meadow in front of us. We made camp and settled in for an evening around the campfire. Late in the evening I noticed the usual forest sounds of crickets and tree frogs had stopped. It was dead silent. The silence unnerved me but my friend Toby assured me our laughter and chatter had quieted them and they'd soon return. But I still felt unsettled.Looking to the west Toby asked, "Where those lights there before?" I turned to look. There on the horizon sat a perfect tight triangle of three very bright stars. We studied them for a few minutes and speculated what they might be. We first thought they were airplane lights but dismissed the idea because of the odd formation. Then they began to move. They rotated once as if on an axis and began a slow ascent into the night sky. They moved in sync as if a single object instead of three. After a few minutes it became obvious that this was one object and not three separate lights. We watched it for some time. The lights on each point of the triangle grew brighter and expanded. The points stayed equidistant to one another as it gained altitude and speed. The area inside the triangle was solid black, much darker than the surrounding night sky. As it traveled over stars they would blink-out and blink back on again as it moved by. Soon, it grew large enough to devour entire fields of stars. We watched as the triangle made a steady trek toward our campsite, growing exponentially as it approached. At a height of about 2,000 feet above us it came to a halt. It was enormous. It was as if someone cut a perfect triangle from a sky filled with a billion stars.As we watched this giant triangle over our heads I recall that I suddenly felt disinterested. My friend was equally apathetic and hardly a word was spoken between us. The crickets and tree frogs had not returned but I no longer felt unnerved. Picking up a flashlight Toby said, "I wonder what will happen happen if I try to signal it?" I was too slow to snatch it from his hand. Holding it up and he flashed his light three times at the center of the triangle. We waited to see if anything would happen. We didn't have long to wait.From the center of the triangle a beacon of light about the diameter of a softball came down as if someone had flipped a switch. The light was centered on our campfire, not much more than embers by now. It was intense, like a high power searchlight cutting through fog. We watched disinterested like casual observers. Then as quickly as it appeared it switched off. In its place came a laser-like beam of light no broader than a pencil. It darted quickly and danced about the campsite as if scanning us. The beam struck my chest and head. I recall it struck Toby as well as it darted around the campsite. Then it occurred to me that Toby had been wrong. The nighttime noises of the forest had not returned. But something would take its place ...Sometimes a bad dream isn't just a bad dream. Sometimes it's you're worst nightmare..</p><p>Terry Lovelace has an undergraduate degree in psychology and a juris doctor from Western Michigan University.

He served on active duty in the USAF from 1973 to 1979. He was trained as a medic/EMT and drove an ambulance at Whiteman Air Force Base for his entire enlistment. In 1977 he and a coworker named Tobias went to Devils Den State Park in Northwestern Arkansas to photograph wildlife. Eagles in particular. Rather than stay in the designated campground they opted to drive deep into the wilderness to find an area of high ground better suited for eagles. They came to a small summit, a plateau with a carpet of late blooming wildflowers and a treeline almost halfway around. It was perfect. They set up camp with the meadow in front of them and the treeline to their back. Exhausted from the day&#39;s travel they were sitting around what was left of a campfire. Terry noted that all of the wildlife sounds they had heard just an hour earlier were now silent. He found it unnerving. He asked Toby, &#34;It&#39;s so quiet ... is that normal?&#34; Toby assured him it was and said their laughter had quieted them. &#34;Just wait, they&#39;ll be back,&#34; Toby said with confidence. At that moment something on the western horizon caught Toby&#39;s attention. It was a triangle of three bright stars. &#34;Hey, were those there before,&#34; he asked? &#34;No,&#34; Terry replied, &#34;not that I recall.&#34; They were discussing what they could be when they suddenly moved. They were both amazed! The three stars rotated as if on an axis. A few minutes later they began a slow ascent straight up. As it climbed higher in the night sky it grew larger, with its three points of light spreading further apart as it climbed. It was obvious this was a single solid object and not three objects moving in unison. Toby noted the area inside the triangle was deep black, much darker than the night sky. They both noted that as it moved past a field of stars they would bling-out for a moment until it had past, and then blink back on. Terry noted the uneasiness he felt earlier when the forest fell silent had left him. He felt a calm wash over him. Later, Toby would admit to feeling almost sedated.

The technique is very simple you simply mix the two-part resin together and pour into a bezel or pendant. Rings, pendants, brooches, cufflinks, hairpins and bracelets are all easy to make and look incredibly professional when done.&nbsp; <br><br>In this inspiring book, well-known crafter Sara Naumann shows you just how easy and quick resin jewellery is to make, using minimal equipment and readily available products, and provides over 50 fabulous projects for you to try. You can add numerous items to the resin to achieve different effects. You can place paper in the bezels to act as a background to the resin such as old book paper, map paper, scrapbook paper and photographs. Paper can also be painted, stencilled, or layered with washi tape before being coated with resin.&nbsp;Try sheet music for a vintage vibe, or origami papers for a fresh, contemporary look.&nbsp; <br><br>In addition, you can also immerse various items in the resin before it cures, such as dried flowers and leaves, feathers, shells, beads and charms, or try adding glitter, coloured inks, nail polish and virtually anything else you can think of.&nbsp; <br><br>The versatility of resin jewellery is awe-inspiring, providing papercrafters as well as jewellery-makers with all the skills and inspiration they need to design and make their own stunning pieces.</p><p>Sara Naumann is an American mixed-media artist, writer and workshop instructor. She lives with her husband and small daughter in the Baltic sea town of Sopot, Poland, having moved there after 5 years in Amsterdam. Her passion is for stamping and mixed-media - and she shares that passion through teaching, writing and designing. Her aim is to take the mystery out of things that can seem intimidating or unfamiliar, leaving you free to enjoy the creative process.I have used resin before but not for jewellery and my approach was based on knowledge gleaned from random videos on a well-known online platform! Having this book in front of me has been a revelation. The instructions are clear and concise. Lots of good photos when you need them and plenty of good tips to overcome the inevitable hiccups such as air bubbles. Resin does one job (but does it very well) so it&#39;s interesting to see ways to stretch that out into a variety of projects and finishes. This book builds up techniques from scratch, leading you into gradually more complicated and lengthy procedures, covering any possible hitches along the way. I suspect anyone doing resin jewellery would want to eventually experiment with their own style and so the gallery provides inspiration, broadening out the knowledge in order to reach that end. * Sass Tetzlaff * As a newcomer to resin, I was hoping for a book that would both inspire and teach me. I was not disappointed. Apart from the obvious instructions in how to carry out each project, the author has added loads of tips which will helped enormously. The techniques section is clear and jargon free so that I never felt out of my comfort zone. Fabulous photography throughout makes this a lovely book to browse through too. There are enough projects to inspire and each has step by step instructions. I would definitely recommend this to anyone considering making resin jewellery. * Lilly Roskell * working with resin was never something I thought about until I came across this book. My job is working with jewellery but as I am currently on maternity leave I do not have the equipment to carry on at home. This book has shown me some great tips and tricks to make resin jewellery at home fairly inexpensively! I read through the book in one sitting and have a list of resin, bezels and inks to work through some of these projects. If you are looking for a book to make resin jewellery I recommend this, the step by step instructions are easy to understand and the finished pieces look great * Jade Nuttall * I have never made resin jewellery before, but being a crafty person this book was right up my street. Lovely ideas, displayed in clear eye catching photographs. A craters dream!I can&#39;t wait to give it a try * Sharon Rutherford * I have never made resin jewellery before, but being a crafty person this book was right up my street. Lovely ideas, displayed in clear eye catching photographs. A craters dream!I can&#39;t wait to give it a try * Amy Chambers * I was initially struck by the picture on the front of this book. Just my style of pretty and stylish jewellery. I&#39;m a bit craft fan and I have bookcases full of craft books I have bought because I liked the cover project. 90% of those books I have never used despite the initial &#39;i can&#39;t live without this book&#39; feeling that I seem to fall for time and time again . Happily I can report that almost every project in this book is on my to do list. I have already sourced the best deals on resin and the equipment need to complete the projects and even though it&#39;s only March I have planned many of my Christmas gifts. The book has every bit of information need to complete the projects and a great trouble shooting section. Even if you aren&#39;t an experienced crafter I am convinced you will be inspired to take resin jewellery making to new levels using everything from glitter to feathers for pendants, earrings and bracelets that will get your friends and family asking where you bought them. I&#39;m excited to start and I&#39;m sure you will be too. * Belinda Bentley * Anybody who has ever mixed two-component epoxy glue has already got the required skill to make beautiful jewelry from resin. For foolproof tips, what else to add to the mix and fifty projects this book will tell you the rest. I learned how to do this surprisingly simple and fun craft at the age of about eight with a kit. There are some safety precautions to follow as this is a toxic substance but once you know how to use it (and you already will if you are familiar with epoxy) the rest is fairly easy. This might make it sound boring, but it is an extremely versatile medium that can make some professional looking pieces and is a great way of recycling and upcycling all kinds of materials. The first part of the book deals with what you need and how to do the basics, troubleshooting, using paper, beads, findings etc and the rest is devoted to the projects. Before you get to them there is the excellent feature of a double page spread showing thumbnails of all of them so you can see at a glance what would interest you. These are arranged in four categories: using paper, coloring agents, powder inclusions and 3-D inclusions covering most basic aspects of this craft. Each project covers a page and features a large photograph of the finished item, a list of materials and tools plus the instructions as well as a basic description. This tells you a bit about the piece and also what you will learn by making it. Items used include all kinds of papers including wrapping paper, old books and paper napkins, coloring with things like nail polish, paint and ink, adding glitter, flitter and embossing powder and embedding elements such as old watch parts, presed flowers and shells. Most of the pieces are made using findings with frames and bezels but the final section shows how you can repurpose things like odd game tiles, flat metal shapes and even just a plastic sheet for freeform work. In short, this book manages to show how simple and fun resin work is and it is great to see a book on such an overlooked subject. My tip to beginners is get a kit first and you will have all you need to get started. * myshelf.com * Resin jewellery is very easy to make and the technique is incredibly versatile. Popular craft author Sara Naumann shows you how to make beautiful pieces of jewellery for men and women, using simple techniques and inexpensive materials. Great fun and quick to make you can add paper, fabric, photographs, shells, dried flowers, nail polish and more to the resin, producing professional-looking and stylish pieces that are totally unique. There are more than 50 projects to inspire you to create your own resin jewellery for yourself, or as gifts for family and friends. Ideal for beginners and more experienced crafters, prepare to become addicted! * Creative Hobbies * Sara Naum,ann is a papercrafting designer who has been in the art and craft industry for 20 years. This book is designed to introduct you as a beginner to the different projects which can be done with resin. Overall the projects are well photographed, clearly illustrating the descriptive techniques for each project which helps to follow the instructions. Overall this book illustrates very well the many uses of resin and some very inspiring projects for a beginner. It is informative and simple to follow. * The Bead Society Journal * Delightful book that helps anyone create interesting and exciting jewellery. My mother and I used a few of Sara&#39;s projects with successful results. I was surprised how easy it it! My favourite part in he book was 3D inclusions as I love steampunk. Gathering pieces to use is just as much fun! * Emma hunt * Love this book. Am a total beginner but this book takes the time to explain everything to you simply and clearly. It then goes on to have lots of lovely projects with inspiring photos and details of exactly how to recreate each look. * Caoline Keen *</p><h2>WHAT IF?

His friendship with the famous librarian, Lenora, has turned into a series of biographical works devoted to chronicling her adventures.Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Eleven-year-old Lenora is desperately bored. Her wealthy parents have flippantly dismissed Lenora's aspirations to obtain a job at the planetarium, the museum, or the zoo. Worse, she is forced to accompany her inattentive nanny on errands by limousine. Luckily, the nanny needs to stop at the library, and is indeed inattentive. Within the first 10 pages, Lenora discovers a mysterious stone arch in a wall of the library through which she crosses into the realm of a much larger, fantastical library that agrees to give her a job. Dubbed a Fourth Assistant Apprentice Librarian, Lenora fearlessly embarks on a series of short, magical adventures in order to answer patrons' reference questions and provide other customer service. Lenora must also contend with the Forces of Darkness, unsavory individuals in bowler hats dedicated to the causes of censorship, control, and the ignorance of the masses. Breezily episodic and fast-paced, the action here begins right away. Deus ex machina moments abound, but seem fitting to the solemnly whimsical plot. Lenora is dedicated to her new career at any cost, and never once questions any of the fantasy elements she encounters or the responsibilities she is given. Quirkily self-referential in tone, the writing attempts to create inside jokes with the reader, e.g., the hypersensitivity of beluga whales and their unique mastery of English.

He loved the girl for her beautiful face and her sweet heart. But after his wife died, he decided to marry a second time, and his new wife was selfish and cruel. She had two daughters of her own who were just like her. . . . <p>This story of Cinderella is based on the version collected and published by the seventeenth-century author Charles Perrault. Perrault&#x2019;s <i>Cinderella</i> echoes the elegance and luxury of the French court of King Louis XIV, and it&#x2019;s from his version that we get Cinderella&#x2019;s famous glass slippers. Sarah L. Thomson&#x2019;s beautiful retelling of the classic fairy tale is matched with the uniquely stunning artwork of Nicoletta Ceccoli rendered in acrylics on paper and digitally. This is a picture book to treasure.</p></p><p>Sarah L. Thomson has published more than twenty-five books for young readers. She has created fiction and nonfiction, poetry and prose, fantasy and realism for age levels from kindergarten through high school. Her books include an adventure about two friends who rescue a dragon&#x2019;s egg; a picture-book biography of Abraham Lincoln; and a young readers&#x2019; version of the best-selling title <i>Three Cups of Tea</i>; along with poetry for picture- book readers and nonfiction I Can Read! titles about tigers, whales, sharks, gorillas, and snakes. She is the author of <i>Pirates, Ho!</i>, illustrated by Stephen Gilpin; <i>Around the Neighborhood</i>, illustrated by Jana Christy; and <i>Cinderella</i>, illustrated by Nicoletta Ceccoli. Sarah lives in Portland, Maine, with her daughter, who helps with inspiration, and her two cats, who help by lying on the piece of paper that she needs most. Visit her online: www.sarahlthomson.comThis elegant retelling of the beloved fairy tale follows the story line that Perrault introduced and Disney made so familiar. The gentle text streamlines the story, beginning and ending appropriately with &#x201c;Once upon a time&#x201d; and &#x201c;happily ever after.&#x201d; The fairy godmother appears on cue, applies her magic touch with specific instructions, and then disappears. The prince is rightfully smitten with Cinderella&#x2019;s &#x201c;gentle eyes and sweet smile.&#x201d; Other than the stepsisters being unable to dance at the wedding due to their sore feet, the story plays out as expected. The dreamlike illustrations and Cinderella&#x2019;s delicate, childlike face and undeveloped figure provide enough room for many little girls to slip inside. The details hint at Louis XIV&#x2019;s style and have the requisite storybook castle perched on a mountaintop at the end of a winding road. The compositions support the text beautifully, moving readers along in muted tones of mostly blues, greens, and Cinderella&#x2019;s brown dress. The closing scene is satisfying as the prince tenderly kisses Cinderella&#x2019;s cheek against a white background with a pink heart-shaped tree and white doves overhead. There&#x2019;s always room for a good retelling of this classic tale and this one will be loved.&#x2013;School Library Journal, January 2013</p><h2>Deacon Wives: Fresh Ideas to Encourage Your Husband and the Church</h2><p><p>In describing the qualities of a church deacon, the Bible also emphasizes the traits of his companion: &#x201c;Wives, too, must be worthy of respect, not slanderers, self-controlled, faithful in everything&#x201d; (1 Timothy 3:11).

But even with all the leadership training programs and "expert" advice available, effective leadership still eludes many people and organizations. One reason, says Daniel Goleman, is that such experts offer advice based on inference, experience, and instinct, not on quantitative data. Now, drawing on research of more than 3,000 executives, Goleman explores which precise leadership behaviors yield positive results. He outlines six distinct leadership styles, each one springing from different components of emotional intelligence. Each style has a distinct effect on the working atmosphere of a company, division, or team, and, in turn, on its financial performance. Coercive leaders demand immediate compliance. Authoritative leaders mobilize people toward a vision. Affiliative leaders create emotional bonds and harmony. Democratic leaders build consensus through participation. Pacesetting leaders expect excellence and self-direction. And coaching leaders develop people for the future. The research indicates that leaders who get the best results don't rely on just one leadership style; they use most of the styles in any given week. Goleman details the types of business situations each style is best suited for, and he explains how leaders who lack one or more of these styles can expand their repertories. He maintains that with practice leaders can switch among leadership styles to produce powerful results, thus turning the art of leadership into a science.</p> <p>The Harvard Business Review Classics series offers you the opportunity to make seminal Harvard Business Review articles a part of your permanent management library.

Few would seriously subscribe to this notion of justice. Yet in 2001, a rapper named Mac whose music had gained national recognition was convicted of manslaughter after the prosecutor quoted liberally from his album <em>Shell Shocked</em>. Mac was sentenced to thirty years in prison, where he remains. And his case is just one of many nationwide.</p> <p>Over the last three decades, as rap became increasingly popular, prosecutors saw an opportunity: they could present the sometimes violent, crime-laden lyrics of amateur rappers as confessions to crimes, threats of violence, evidence of gang affiliation, or revelations of criminal motive&#x2014;and judges and juries would go along with it. Detectives have reopened cold cases on account of rap lyrics and videos alone, and prosecutors have secured convictions by presenting such lyrics and videos of rappers as autobiography. Now, an alarming number of aspiring rappers are imprisoned. No other form of creative expression is treated this way in the courts.</p> <p><em>Rap on Trial</em> places this disturbing practice in the context of hip hop history and exposes what&#x2019;s at stake.

He shaped Rome for generations, and his name became a synonym for "emperor" -- not only in Rome but as far away as Germany and Russia. He is best known as the general who defeated the Gauls and doubled the size of Rome's territories. But, as Philip Freeman describes in this fascinating new biography, Caesar was also a brilliant orator, an accomplished writer, a skilled politician, and much more. <br> <br> Julius Caesar was a complex man, both hero and villain. He possessed great courage, ambition, honor, and vanity. Born into a noble family that had long been in decline, he advanced his career cunningly, beginning as a priest and eventually becoming Rome's leading general. He made alliances with his rivals and then discarded them when it suited him. He was a spokesman for the ordinary people of Rome, who rallied around him time and again, but he profited enormously from his conquests and lived opulently. Eventually he was murdered in one of the most famous assassinations in history. <br> <br> Caesar's contemporaries included some of Rome's most famous figures, from the generals Marius, Sulla, and Pompey to the orator and legislator Cicero as well as the young politicians Mark Antony and Octavius (later Caesar Augustus). Caesar's legendary romance with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra still fascinates us today. <br> <br> In this splendid biography, Freeman presents Caesar in all his dimensions and contradictions. With remarkable clarity and brevity, Freeman shows how Caesar dominated a newly powerful Rome and shaped its destiny. This book will captivate readers discovering Caesar and ancient Rome for the first time as well as those who have a deep interest in the classical world.</p><p><b>Philip Freeman</b> is Qualley Professor of Classics at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, and a former professor of classics at Washington University in St. Louis.

His rapid advance caught Pompey and the optimates totally off-guard and threw Rome into a panic. It was precisely the effect Caesar had intended. </p><p> Caesar's first stop was the old Umbrian town of Ariminum (modern Rimini) just ten miles beyond the Rubicon. Sulla had sacked the town several decades earlier, but Caesar quickly occupied this strategic gateway to the south without any bloodshed. It was here that Mark Antony caught up with his sponsor after fleeing from Rome. Caesar played up his arrival for all it was worth to further motivate his army and justify his move against the Senate. Look at him, he cried, as he led Antony before his troops. This man is a sacrosanct tribune of the people, manhandled by the Senate and driven from Rome in defiance of all that is holy and just. Even Sulla, who had little respect for the common man, never dared to interfere with the rights of the tribunes. Will you allow this to stand? Will you let a small cadre of self-serving nobles who care nothing for the true welfare of the state destroy centuries of tradition and rob you of your freedom? As for me, Caesar exclaimed as he wept bitter tears and tore his robe in grief, will you let Pompey and the optimates destroy my dignity? We've fought bravely together for nine years against Gauls and Germans alike -- and we won! Are you afraid to face Pompey and his ragged band of cowards? Are you afraid to follow me to victory? </p><p> It was a beautiful performance. The soldiers declared that they were ready to follow Caesar anywhere to defend his honor and restore the rightful power of the tribunes. Part of their enthusiasm may have grown from a rumor that he would make all of them knights, but they doubtless would have risked everything for him in any case. He had lifted them from poverty and taught them to believe in their ability to accomplish the impossible. They had beaten Ariovistus and his ferocious Germans, they had sailed beyond the edge of the world to Britain and returned, they had conquered Vercingetorix and the whole army of Gaul. Caesar had also put more money in their pockets than they had ever dreamed of back when they were struggling on the farm. Now they would restore the stolen honor of their commander and win undying glory for themselves, not to mention a tidy bit of loot. </p><p> Meanwhile in Rome, there was chaos in the streets. Countless frightened refugees were flooding into the city from the countryside, adding to the panic among the already terrified inhabitants of Rome. Stories flew among the crowds of dire portents -- blood had fallen as rain from the sky, lightning had struck the holy temples, statues of the gods were sweating, and a mule had given birth to a foal. Fights broke out between partisans of Caesar and Pompey, mobs raged violently through the streets, and no one seemed to be in charge. The optimates turned on Pompey and berated him for letting Caesar cross the Rubicon. Where are the armies you had only to stomp your foot to raise? What are you going to do now? they demanded. </p><p> Pompey had an answer for them, but they didn't like it. Their only chance was to evacuate Rome and regroup in southern Italy. From there, it would probably be necessary to withdraw further across the sea to Greece. Then, like Sulla years before, the senatorial forces could gather their armies and retake Italy. Pompey pointed out that holding Rome meant nothing in the long term. It was men that won wars, not empty buildings. His scattered forces were still ten times the size of Caesar's army and would crush the upstart general in the end as surely as Sulla had destroyed Cinna and Marius. Pompey then warned them darkly that he would consider anyone who remained in the city a traitor to Rome. With that, Pompey took the Appian Way south, followed by almost every magistrate and senator in Rome. The refugees and common people of the city would have to face alone whatever horrors awaited them from Caesar's troops. <br> </p><p> It wasn't long until Caesar received two visitors sent by Pompey himself. As Caesar writes, they came with a private message from the general expressing his regret to his former father-in-law that matters had reached such a sorry state. Pompey exclaimed that his recent actions were nothing personal against Caesar, but were merely the result of his lifelong desire to serve his country -- a desire that always took precedence over his own wishes. Caesar, likewise, should put the welfare of Rome before his own pride, no matter how unjustly he believed he had been treated. Pompey urged Caesar to be reasonable and not let his bruised dignity lead Rome into civil war. </p><p> Caesar felt insulted by Pompey's condescending tone, but sent the envoys back to him with an olive branch. Caesar declared that he, too, had always put the needs of the state above his own desires, but he was fighting for the rights of the Roman people as well as his own honor. He therefore proposed that the Italian peninsula be demilitarized. He and his army would leave Italy if Pompey would at the same time withdraw to Spain with his troops. Then the Senate and the popular assemblies could meet in peace to settle everything without the threat of armed force from either side. Finally, he urged that he and Pompey meet face-to-face to work out the details of the agreement without the tiresome interference of politicians. </p><p> Cicero, who was in Pompey's camp at the time, reports that the message from Caesar arrived on January 23, 49 B.C. Whatever Pompey might have wished to do if left to his own devices, he was overruled by the optimates. They sent a letter back to Caesar agreeing that Pompey would go to Spain at some future date, but only if Caesar first withdrew from Italy. Until that time, they would continue to recruit and train their army to defend the state. And, of course, the optimates were not about to let Pompey meet privately with Caesar. </p><p> It's fascinating to see how the different parties viewed the negotiations. Caesar portrayed himself as an injured party: "It was an unfair offer," he exclaimed. But Cicero wrote to his friend Atticus that "Caesar would be mad not to accept, especially as his demands were so impudent." The practical result was that the discussions went nowhere and communications between the two parties ceased. <br> </p><p> Caesar now sent Mark Antony to hold the mountain passes north of Rome while he himself continued his advance south along the Adriatic coast. By early February, he had peacefully taken all of Picenum -- an especially galling development to Pompey as it was his home region. Throughout the wider area of north central Italy, towns were flocking to Caesar's banner, much to the consternation of the optimates. Caesar portrays this support as sincere patriotism and affection for his just cause, though most townspeople cared little who won the war as long as they were left alone. The towns knew they were facing Caesar's army on their doorsteps while most of Pompey's troops were far away, thus the sudden swell of support. At Iguvium in Umbria, Pompey's lieutenant Thermus withdrew his few troops from the town in the face of open hostility. Even more telling was Caesar's reception at the ancient hill town of Auximum. There the local town council met with Attius Varus, the governor of Roman Africa, who was occupying their town with a garrison of Pompey's soldiers. The councilmen explained that they had no interest in imperial politics, but they felt it most unwise to resist the celebrated general Caesar and his veteran army. They urged Varus to consider his own safety and get out of town while he still could. Varus took the council's advice and quickly fled south. When Caesar learned of their actions, he warmly thanked the councilmen and promised he would not forget their support. </p><p> Pompey was near Naples at the time trying to rally his senatorial supporters, raise troops among the local farmers, and even recruit gladiators owned by Caesar from a nearby training camp, all to little avail. It was becoming clear to Pompey, if not to the optimates, that holding Italy was a lost cause. He would have to reach the fortified port city of Brundisium in Italy's heel as quickly as possible and from there sail to Greece. Pompey was confident he could win the war in the long run if he was allowed time to build an overwhelming force to return and invade Italy. Some of the optimates saw the good sense in this plan, but most detested the idea of yielding control of Italy to Caesar, even temporarily. The mood in Pompey's camp was accordingly contentious and dispirited as senators and soldiers alike packed their bags. </p><p> Meanwhile Caesar was having much better luck as he marched southward along the coast. Another legion from Gaul caught up with him near the town of Cingulum, doubling the size of his army. Cingulum itself threw open its gates and eagerly welcomed him, a deed particularly pleasing to Caesar since the town had recently been founded by his former comrade Labienus. <br> </p><p> Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus had been one of Caesar's most committed enemies for almost twenty years. He had watched Caesar's victories in Gaul with burning jealousy. His own grandfather had first beaten the Allobroges and Arverni seventy years before, thus he considered the northern lands by right a family fiefdom. The Senate had appointed Domitius the new governor of Gaul, but his plans had been ruined by Caesar's march across the Rubicon. Although Caesar had beaten him at every turn, Domitius would not back down, even if the rest of the optimates ran away to Greece. Promising rich rewards, he gathered a hearty band of local tribesmen and snakeworshipping Marsi warriors from the mountains of central Italy and set out to meet his nemesis. When Pompey ordered him to withdraw ...</p></p><h2>Writers Read Better: Nonfiction: 50+ Paired Lessons That Turn Writing Craft Work Into Powerful Genre Reading (Corwin Literacy)</h2><p><strong><em>When It Comes to Reading, Writers Have an Advantage</em></strong><br> <br> We know that writing skills reinforce reading skills, but what&#x2019;s the best way to capitalize on this relationship?

As a social space it rivaled&#x2014;and in some ways surpassed&#x2014;the synagogue as the primary gathering place for the Jewish community. In popular culture it has been the setting for classics like When Harry Met Sally. And today, after a long period languishing in the trenches of the hopelessly old-fashioned, it is experiencing a nostalgic resurgence. </p><p>Pastrami on Rye is the first full-length history of the New York Jewish deli. The deli, argues Ted Merwin, reached its full flowering not in the immigrant period, as some might assume, but in the interwar era, when the children of Jewish immigrants celebrated the first flush of their success in America by downing sandwiches and cheesecake in theater district delis. But it was the kosher deli that followed Jews as they settled in the outer boroughs of the city, and that became the most tangible symbol of their continuing desire to maintain a connection to their heritage. Ultimately, upwardly mobile American Jews discarded the deli as they transitioned from outsider to insider status in the middle of the century. Now contemporary Jews are returning the deli to cult status as they seek to reclaim their cultural identities. </p><p>Richly researched and compellingly told, Pastrami on Rye gives us the surprising story of a quintessential New York institution.</p></p><p><b>Ted Merwin</b> is Associate Professor of Religion and Judaic Studies at Dickinson College (PA), where he is Founding Director of the Milton B. Asbell Center for Jewish Life. He writes about Jewish theater, dance, and food for the New York Jewish Week and other major newspapers and magazines."Thorough and thoughtful, scholarly and readable, Ted MerwinsPastrami on Rye provides a vital addition to the academic literature in cultural history, American studies, American Jewish studies, food studies, and popular culture studies."

(<i>Santa Fe New Mexican</i>)<br><br>"Pastrami on Rye is both a celebration of the deli and an elegy for it. This lively book traces the delis evolution from dynamic gathering place to kitschy tourist site, peppered with hefty doses of popular culture. Merwin tells a fascinating story of cultural and culinary assimilation as he explores what it means to be modern and American. This book left me longing for the lost delis of my youth!" (Darra Goldstein,Founding Editor, Gastronomica: The Journal of Food and Culture)<br><br>"In Pastrami on Rye, Merwin finally addresses the pressing question overlooked in his first book on New York Jews (In Their Own Image): but where did they eat? This fun and informative examination of the New York Jewish deli is half history and half love story; batampte und geshmacht, with a heaping helping of sakhelyoull kvell before you plotz!"

After doing exhaustive research into the subject, Dr. Merwin has put his scholarly pen and thoughtful gaze to work to create this marvelous book. I got really hungry for pastrami reading this comprehensive story of the American deli. Now that is a sign of a great read." (Joan Nathan,author of Quiches, Kugels and Couscous: My Search for Jewish Cooking in France)<br><br>"Merwin has set out to trace the rise and fall of the delicatessen in American Jewish culture, using this analysis to help us understand the American-immigrant experience. He has been more than successful. By meticulous and thorough research, Merwin has shown that in the postwar migration to the suburbs, city neighborhoods fragmented and delis closed." (<i>St. Louis Jewish Light</i>)<br><br>"In Pastrami on Rye, Ted Merwin gamely sets out to show how American Jews evolved from the clannish immigrants of the late 1800s into well-heeled secularists who atone for their parents' assimilation through (mostly culinary) nostalgia." (<i>The Times Literary Supplement,Samuel Ashworth</i>)<br><br>"Merwins tasty exploration of deli cuisine and culture also tracks larger shifts in the American Jewish experience, particularly in the post-World War II period when delis upstaged shuls as Jewish gathering places."

Both culinary and cultural history, this book will be of interest to scholars and common readers alike, the former for its incisive interpretations of modern Jewish foodways and the latter for its ability to recreate a time and place that was 'home' for so many 20th century Jews in America. Its evocation of deli menus alone will get your mouth watering." (David Kraemer,author of Jewish Eating and Jewish Identity Through the Ages)<br><br>"The fruit of more than ten years of research and writing, Mr. Merwin's account shows that delis have been a rich part of the story of Jewish assimilation in America."

A stunning, genre-bending graphic novel.&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>School Library Journal&nbsp;</i>(starred review)</b><br><br>The curtain rises on New York City. The dazzling lights cast shadows that grow ever darker as the glitzy prosperity of the Roaring Twenties screeches to a halt. Enter a cast of familiar characters: a young girl, Samantha White, returning after being sent away by her cruel stepmother, the Queen of the Follies, years earlier; her father, the King of Wall Street, who survives the stock market crash only to suffer a strange and sudden death; seven street urchins, brave protectors for a girl as pure as snow; and a mysterious stock ticker that holds the stepmother in its thrall, churning out ticker tape imprinted with the wicked words: &#x201c;Another . . . More Beautiful . . . KILL.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Matt Phelan sets his graphic retelling of &#x201c;Snow White&#x201d; in 1920s New York, with both its Ziegfeld Follies glamour and its impoverished Dead End Kids.<br>&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review<br><br>The visuals are deeply effective: entire sections are wordless, propelling the reader through dramatic scenes and inviting reflection during quiet, contemplative spots...Pencil, ink, and watercolor illustrations break out of loose panel structuring; sharp lines and shadow heighten tension and expanses of open white space sometimes draw the eye to a specific scene. This graphic novel will find a welcome home with fairy-tale fans who have outgrown the Disney version (or, less likely, the Grimm version) but still find the tale compelling.<br>&#x2014;Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books (starred review)<br><br>Phelan (<i>Bluffton</i>) delivers a spectacular 20th-century update of &#x201c;Snow White,&#x201d; transplanting the story to Jazz Age and Depression-era New York City, where themes of jealousy, beauty, and power find a comfortable home...Moody gray and sepia panels carry the story forward, punctuated by splashes of lurid red&#x2014;for an animal heart, procured at a butcher&#x2019;s shop, or an apple tainted with a syringe. Snow&#x2019;s affectionate relationship with &#x201c;the Seven,&#x201d; a group of street children, is among this adaptation&#x2019;s most potent elements. The boys are hesitant to tell Snow their names, but readers will want tissues on hand when they finally do.<br>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly (starred review)<br><br>Spanning the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression, Phelan&#x2019;s noir-esque adaption of the classic fairy tale is atmospheric, clever, and touching...Especially resonant are the relationships that the heroine builds with her young protectors. The last few colorful pages will tug at heartstrings as Snow, the Seven, and an intrepid Detective Prince get their happy endings. A stunning, genre-bending graphic novel for all middle grade and middle school collections.<br>&#x2014;School Library Journal (starred review)<br><br>Phelan masterfully shifts a tale heavily reliant on magic and fantasy into a realistic and historical setting without compromising plausibility. Creating sweeping and dreamy watercolors that play with emotion and color, Phelan is an exquisite visual storyteller, and he lets expressive, wordless sequences carry a large portion of his interpretation. With a keen historical slant, a bit of action and intrigue, high visual interest, and the fairy-tale leaning, this will awe a wide readership. Brilliant.<br>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews (starred review)<br><br>Pencil, ink, and watercolor images (in mostly sepia tones, with occasional spots of color: red for the poisoned apple, for example) move readers&#x2019; eyes across each page, providing an appropriately cinematic noir sensibility. This cinematic effect is further enhanced by the feel of constant movement, the varied panel sizes, and a judicious use of text. Some scenes are wordless; for others, Phelan uses varied fonts to enhance the drama. By the final wordless all- color sequence (spoiler: there is a happy ending), it is clear that this is an original and darkly beautiful take on the classic tale.<br>&#x2014;Horn Book<br><br>In a series of silent-movie-like vignettes, Phelan puts a Jazz Age spin on the classic tale of Snow White...Readers hungry for graphic adaptations of fairy tales will find their appetites slaked here.<br>&#x2014;Booklist<br><br>I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever actually enjoyed the story of <i>Snow White</i> until now.

The Sony Picture Classics&#x2013;distributed documentary <i>American Hardcore </i>premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. This revised and expanded second edition contains hundreds of new bands, thirty new interviews, flyers, a new chapter ("Destroy Babylon"), and a new art gallery with over 125 rare photos and images.</p></p><p>Besides the bestselling &#34;American Hardcore,&#34; Steven Blush is also author of &#34;American Hair Metal&#34; (Feral House), and &#34;.45 Dangerous Minds&#34; (Creation). Blush also co-produced the eponymous &#34;American Hardcore&#34; documentary released by Sony Classics, and was the publisher and primary editor of the award-winning &#34;Seconds&#34; interview magazine. He also writes for Paper and Interview and music-oriented magazines.Culling quotes from numerous interviews conducted over a five-year period, Blush presents an oral history of the first generation of American hardcore music (1980-86) what he deems its golden age. Charting the rise of bands such as Black Flag and the Misfits, as well as more famous hardcore alumni like the Beastie Boys and Moby, the book is divided into chapters based on different regional scenes. Rather than having a chronological narrative, then, the book bounces back and forth in time, from chapter to chapter, which will possibly confuse readers unfamiliar with the people and bands discussed. The author's tone also veers between that of a jaded ex-hardcore kid and a sentimental old-timer, but his account is nonetheless fascinating and rings with experience (he promoted hardcore shows and tours in the 1980s). It should also be noted that American Hardcore is the first book to document hardcore on a national level; books such as Cynthia Connolly's Banned in D.C. (1988) and Bri Hurley's Making a Scene (o.p.) have regional focuses. Blush also includes an extensive discography (just on vinyl and cassette, however) that lists noteworthy as well as forgettable releases. Recommended for academic libraries and ones with extensive music collections.

While his other friends have managed to work through their grief and move on, Andy allows death to become the focus of his life.

When star basketball player Robert Washington and his three closest friends mix drinking and driving in a postgame victory celebration, Robert is killed in an auto accident. The driver, Andy Jackson, is unable to resolve his feelings of guilt and remorse. Neither Andy's parents nor his psychologist accurately perceive the depth of Andy's depression, with tragic results--Andy, at the end, commits suicide. The story emerges through newspaper articles, journal entries, homework assignments, letters, and conversations that give the book immediacy; the teenage conversational idiom is contemporary and well written. Andy's perceptions of the racism directed toward young black males--by teachers, guidance counselors, and clerks in shopping malls--will be recognized by African American YAs. Although some heavy-handed didacticism detracts from the novel's impact, the characters and their experiences will captivate teen readers. The novel is also suitable for use in curricular units dealing with alcohol abuse, suicide, and racism. <i>Merri Monks</i></p><h2>Great American Gospel for Guitar (Easy Guitar with Notes &amp; Tab)</h2><p>(Easy Guitar).

In a sudden urge to abandon self-sufficiency, he yells for his mom&#x2014;but congestion makes it sound like he's asking for "Bob," which is coincidentally the name of his dog. Instead of a warm, comforting parent, Louie gets his drooly, high-strung dalmatian. This is the central joke of the book. (For the former Bob, the "o" is stylized to look like a heart, while for the latter, it simply looks like an "o.") Readers are told that the text should "be read as though you have the worst cold ever." The story is child-centric if a bit unfocused and is in keeping with busy families and the havoc caused by ailing children. Cordell's Jules Feiffer&#x2014;esque illustrations are entertaining, even though the unvaried white background could use more pep. VERDICT Wheezy, sneezy kids are likely to enjoy hearing about someone who's as sick as they are and to giggle at the ongoing confusion.

Gather your ingredients: 1 egg (beaten but not conquered), 1 cup milk, 2 tablespoons canola oil (or melted butter), 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 cups flour, &nbsp;teaspoon salt, 3 teaspoons baking powder, and &nbsp;cup blueberries (fresh or frozen).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 2: Did that take you forever? If so, chug a cup of joe. Then, in a large bowl, using an electric or hand beater, mix your egg, milk, oil, and sugar.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Step 3: With a wooden spoon, stir in the flour, salt, and baking powder. Don't stress about the lumps! It's better to leave a few in.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 4: Pop a few blueberries in your mouth, and then add the rest to the batter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Step 5: Add a pat of butter (or a drizzle of oil) to a frying pan, and bring it to a sizzle on medium heat. No matter how hungry you are, resist turning up the flame or you'll have burned pancakes with raw insides.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Step 6: Using a ladle, drop some batter into the center of the pan to form a flapjack of your desired size. A quarter cup drop will yield about nine palm-sized cakes.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 7: When the edges begin to bubble up, scoot a spatula beneath the flapjack and flip it over. Refrain from throwing it in the air, unless your floor is super clean and no one is watching.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Step 8: Once both sides are golden brown, remove from heat, plate, and serve.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>More Nifty Tips: &nbsp; �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're going to use frozen berries, defrost them first.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spritz a few drops of water into your frying pan before adding the batter.

We'd just get one from out back, wring his head off, cook him, and eat him. I didn't dread doing it then, but I wouldn't want to do it now." -Elouise Bruce&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>How to Roast a Whole Chicken&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></i><br>Step 1: Go to your local butcher, farm, or grocer and buy the whole bird. You'll need about &nbsp;pound per person. Dig out your roasting pan, and crank up your oven to 375 degrees. Then, shush! Give a listen. Is your belly growling? If so, have a little snack. It takes a good hour to roast a 3- to 3-pound bird.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 2: Get acquainted with your chicken. If you're temporarily grossed out, there's no kind way to say this: Get over yourself. You're about to eat this bird (and it's going to be delicious), so you might as well take responsibility for cooking it. Then, peek inside your chicken. If you see a bag of parts, pull it out. (It's the giblets, or heart, neck, and liver of a chicken, not necessarily your chicken. You can simmer them in water to make a broth or gravy, or you can just toss them.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 3: Give your bird a bath for good measure. Rinse it, inside and out, under cold water, and then pat it dry with a paper towel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Step 4: Prepare your seasonings. Mix softened butter (about &nbsp;to &nbsp;stick) with generous amounts of your favorite herbs and spices. Try chopped garlic (4 to 6 cloves), diced rosemary (about 5 full twigs' worth), and salt and pepper ( teaspoon or more). Or, chopped garlic, lemon zest, thyme, and tarragon. How much of each? Enough. Basically, just throw it all together. It's hard to cluck it up.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Step 5: Using your fingers (or, if you're still grossed out, an upside-down spoon), separate the skin from the meat, being careful not to rip or puncture it, or your bird will lose its juices. Once you've got some wiggle room in there, smush your butter mixture between the skin and meat, making sure to get it into every nook and cranny. Then, rub butter all over the outside of the bird, too, so it'll brown nicely in the oven.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 6: Season the inside of your chicken. Sprinkle in a good amount of salt and pepper, and then toss in a couple of whole garlic cloves, whatever leftover herbs you might have from your butter mixture (stems included), and a quartered lemon.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Step 7: Place your bird, breast and legs up, in your roasting pan. Tuck the tip of the wings underneath the body and, if you'd like, tie the legs together with kitchen string. It's not necessary, but it adds a dose of fancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Step 8: Pop your chicken in the oven, set your timer for an hour, go have a glass of wine or a gimlet, and wait.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Step 9: When the timer goes off, check on your chicken. Tilt it until some juices run out. If they're pinkish, it's not done yet. If they're clear, stick a kitchen thermometer into the fattest part of the thigh. Only when it reads 165 degrees is it done.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Step 10: Set your chicken on a platter on the countertop and let it rest for 10 minutes, so it gets good and juicy. (If you'd like to make gravy, now's the time. See page 8 for instructions.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 11: Present your chicken to your dinner guests, preferably using grand gestures. Enjoy their oos and aahs, and then enjoy the chicken.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>More Nifty Tips&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></i><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buy an organic bird, if you can. That means it was raised with outdoor access and without antibiotics and was fed a vegetarian organic diet. It'll taste better and give you good karma.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When buying a fresh chicken, check the sell-by date before purchasing and eyeball the amount of juice in the package. Lots of liquid may mean the bird has been sitting around for a while.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To defrost a frozen chicken, keep it wrapped, put it on a tray, and set it in your fridge twenty-four hours before you plan to roast it. Do not set it out on your countertop, or you'll have some serious bacteria issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No roasting pan? Buy a cheapo aluminum one and set it on a cookie tray (for stability) before placing it in the oven.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a healthier option, skip the butter. Just rub your bird with dry herbs and spices, and then drizzle with olive oil. Mmmmm.&nbsp;<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always wash your hands-hello-with soap, after handling raw chicken.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After you eat the chicken, toss the carcass in a large pot and cover with water. Add a few whole onions, some carrot chunks, and quartered celery stalks, plus salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then let simmer for 4 hours. Skim off the fat, transfer to airtight containers, and store in the freezer for up to 3 months. Homemade chicken stock tastes better than anything you can get in a store, and it's cheaper, too!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>Get Sauced ���&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;"The people who love to eat make the best cooks." -Grace Fortunato&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>How to Carve a Roasted Bird&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></i><br>Step 1: Choose your longest, most impressive-looking knife, and hone it. (See page 27 for instructions.) The sharper your blade, the less likely it'll appear that a caveman cooked your Thanksgiving dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 2: Position the turkey, breast side up, drumsticks pointing toward you, and snip off any strings.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 3: Remove the legs. With your knife along the body, blade down, slice through the skin that attaches the leg to the body, down along the thigh meat, and finally through the joint, where the bones meet. (Don't saw through any bones, Hannibal. You'll make a mess. Just use the tip of your knife to sever the joint.) Set the leg and thigh aside, and repeat once more unless you bought a one-legged bird. (If you did that, hopefully you got a discount.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 4: Poke that crazy-long, two-pronged fork that you've probably never used and that came with your knife set into the wing to secure the bird, and then turn your knife blade parallel to your work surface. Make a horizontal cut into the bird, just above the wing and below the breast.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 5: Poke your fork into the top of the bird, place your knife halfway up the breast, and slice down until you meet your horizontal cut. Place that piece of meat on a serving platter, and repeat, working your way up the breast to carve thin slices.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>More Nifty Tips&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let your bird rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving to seal in the juices.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sneak a folded paper towel between the turkey and the plate. It'll keep the turkey from sliding around.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Separate the drumsticks from the thighs before serving to prevent fights at your table.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trim off the wings, if anyone would like those, at their joints with poultry shears.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save your carcass to make a stock.

Whew! That's over with. Nice job.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 4: Starting behind the head and using just the tip of your knife, run your blade along the top edge of the fish, near the dorsal fin, to the tail, slicing along (but not through) the rib cage. As the meat separates from the fish, peel it back and repeat your gentle slicing from head to tail until the full fillet is free. See? That wasn't so bad at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 5: Flip the fish, and repeat steps 2 through 4, for the second fillet. Now, you're a total pro-and you're almost finished!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 6: Inspect each fillet carefully. If you see any bones, pluck them out. Once you think you've got them all out, run your fingers over your fillet to double-check, or your meal may be more memorable-cough, cough-than you bargained for.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 7: Remove the skin by placing each fillet, skin side down, on the cutting board. Holding your knife blade at a 45-degree angle, start on one end and cut through the meat down to (but not through) the skin. Then, pressing the loosened skin down with your fingernail to secure it, turn your blade parallel to your work surface and gently work it down the length of the fillet. Go easy now. Don't force it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 8: Rinse the fillets with cold water, and fry 'em up&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>More Nifty Tips&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></i><br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're buying, not catching, your fish, peek inside the gills. If they're red, it's fresh.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too slimy? You can always wear a pair of gloves.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Squeeze lemon juice on your hands after filleting and before washing to help your patties smell fresh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Rise Up and Save Dough ���&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><br><br>"I remember Mother baking bread. That sure smelled good when you walked home from school. I loved getting a slice with butter. My sister and I each liked the heels. She'd have a hand on one end and I'd have a hand on the other, but my mother put a stop to that." -Jean Dinsmore&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>How to Bake Bread&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br></i>Step 1: Gather up your ingredients: 3 cups bread flour, 3 cups whole wheat flour, 3 cups tepid water, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoons instant dry yeast (a.k.a. "RapidRise yeast"). You'll also need two loaf pans, a touch of oil or butter, and the patience of Job. It's best if you set yourself up with something productive to do, besides clicking "refresh" on your Facebook page for hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 2: In a large bowl, dump in all your ingredients, and combine them into a shaggy mass using your hands. You'll know you've done it right if your mixture looks like a bad '70s carpet. Don't be afraid to get messy! &nbsp;"Gravy was always on our table. It was just part of the meal. A potato wasn't anything without gravy. It's so good." -Alice Loft &nbsp; How to Make Gravy&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 1: While your just-out-of-the-oven meat rests on your serving platter for 10 minutes, pour the drippings from the roasting pan into a bowl. Then, have a glass of wine while you wait for the fat to float to the top. It'll take a few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 2: Gently spoon off the fat, or the top layer of clear goop, so your gravy isn't a greasy mess. Transfer whatever's left in your bowl back to the pan.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 3: Set your roasting pan directly on a burner, fired up to medium heat. Add 1 cup stock and, with a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pan to free up any yummy bits. Let simmer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Step 4: In a separate bowl, make a thickener by mixing 2 tablespoons flour with 4 tablespoons stock. Whisk it like crazy until all lumps are gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Step 5: Pour your thickener into your roasting pan, and whisk like you've never whisked before. Keep going until your gravy (and your bicep) is sizzlingly hot and as thick as you'd like. Too thick? Add more stock. Too thin? Whip up some more flour paste ( one part flour to two parts stock) and add. Too stressed? Have another glass of wine.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Step 6: Season your gravy with salt and pepper, and pour it into a fancy boat or old chipped bowl. Doesn't matter what you put it in, it's still going to taste divine. Serve.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>More Nifty Tips&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></i>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For creamier gravy, replace half the stock with milk.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To stretch your gravy, just add more stock in step 3 and make more thickener (one part flour to two parts stock) in step 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're having trouble skimming the fat off the drippings (step 2), pop the drippings in the freezer for a few minutes. The fat will glob up on top, which makes it easier to scoop out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>Talk Turkey ���&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><h2>Drink the Harvest: Making and Preserving Juices, Wines, Meads, Teas, and Ciders</h2><p><p>Preserving the harvest doesn&#x2019;t have to stop with jam and pickles.

Christianson's fifty-two devotions follow the ten stages of grief outlined in Granger Westberg's helpful book <i>Good Grief</i>, published in 1968. Millions of people have found in it validation for their grief, understanding of their feelings, and a way to live through grief and into a new reality.</p><p>Christianson begins each stage with a reflection on that aspect of grief and then considers what the stage means for the reader's self-understanding and relationships with other people, creation, and God. Each devotion ends with questions to think about and talk about with another person, healing actions one might take, and a prayer.</p><p><i>The Good Grief Devotional</i> provides pastoral care, faces the reality of loss, and points the way to hope. Readers will want to return to this collection year after year as they are changed by their journey.</p></p><p><p><b>Brent D. Christianson</b> is a retired pastor (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) who served parishes in Wisconsin and Minnesota for ten years and in campus ministry for twenty-five years. His poetry has been published in books and journals, and he has written studies for the ELCA. He and his wife, Rebecca, live in Northfield, Minnesota. They have three daughters and two grandchildren.</p><p>"In <em>The Good Grief Devotional: 52 Weeks toward Hope</em>, Christianson has crafted a delightful companion to Granger Westberg's seminal Good Grief. Christianson writes that his wish for this book it to brings its readers hope. And it does. Through a healing recipe of Scripture, poetry, wisdom, and prayer, Christianson brings an offering that I would have been delighted to give to each grieving family in my thirty-plus years as a parish pastor. I can offer no higher praise than that." --Rick Hoyme, retired ELCA bishop and pastor</p> <p>"For years I had a supply of Granger Westberg's classic <em>Good Grief</em> in my pastoral office. I gave one to people who were going through rough waters. Brent D. Christianson's devotional book will be even more helpful for those who have been struck by divorce, death, or another form of loss. Through poetry, lyrical prose, and story, the book speaks openly about the pain of grief and points the reader in the direction of comfort and grace. If read slowly and savored, the fifty-two short chapters promise to bring healing and even joy." --Bill White, ELCA pastor, Madison, Wisconsin</p> <p>"Grief work is indeed good and holy, as Christianson notes. He is a compassionate, hopeful companion for those in the midst of that work. The poems, lyrics, stories, and prayers he has gathered will provide comfort and encouragement in the first year of grief and beyond." --Carla Dahl, Luther Seminary</p> <p>"Brent D. Christianson has written a book of devotions that is an articulate, thoughtful, and helpful response to Granger Westberg's now classic book on the ten stages of grief, <em>Good Grief.</em> Drawing from his personal experience of grief and loss, Holy Scripture, and a deep well of verse written both by him and others more widely read or sung, Christianson invites us to reflect on and share our own experience of grief and loss.Christianson's prose is concise and clear.

A frequent contributor to the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, he has written for the <em>New Yorker, Rolling Stone, Sports Illustrated, Elle,</em> and the <em>Oxford American</em>, and is the editor of the acclaimed book <em>Why I Write</em>. His work has been anthologized in <em>The Best American Short Stories</em> and <em>The Best American Sportswriting</em>. He grew up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and now lives in New York City.</p>[Signature]Reviewed by <i>Sara Nelson</i>For a reviewer who's not all that clear on the difference between basketball and basket weaving, this book is a revelation. Former <i>Esquire</i> editor Blythe's debut is an examination of the rivalry between the University of North Carolina and Duke University college teams; in it, he interviews and profiles players and coaches, and even gives play-by-plays of key games. And yet, it is not "just" a sports book. At heart it's a memoir. Like Pat Conroy's <i>My Losing Season</i> and even Frederick Exley's <i>A Fan's Notes</i>, to which the author Anthony Wofford compares it, <i>To Hate Like This</i> is about family and passion and people and parents and aging and, oh, yeah, some sports, too.Blythe is a native North Carolinan whose UNC passion was bred in the bone; he and his siblings were raised to be genteel and polite about all things, except while watching basketball games, particularly against arch-rival Duke. After living in New York for many years, Blythe returns home as his father is dying and reflects on the passion that has shaped him and, he suggests, his region. Forget the Mason Dixon line, the real division in this border war is between Carolinians who support the Blue Devils and those who live for the Tarheels.Sports fans can expect to enjoy the accounts of particular pivotal games recounted here, but the real revelations for the relatively uninitiated are Blythe's portraits of his characters: the tough-guy coaches like Mike Krzyzewski and Dean Smith, one of whom nearly breaks down confessing that he's still in love with his ex-wife; the nurse tending Blythe's dying father; and, most of all, the father himself, the kind of personality you expect to meet in great southern novels from Harper Lee to Pat Conroy. To call <i>To Hate Like This</i> a sports book is to be only about one-third right. An elegy to place and time and generation, it is also a story of fathers and sons and an elegant testament to the way pastimes are far more than ways to pass the time. <i>(Mar. 1)</i><i>Sara Nelson is the editor-in-chief of Publishers Weekly.</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A native of the Dominican Republic, he splits his time between his homes in Bass Harbor, Maine, and Miami, Florida.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3-A poignant yet gentle portrayal of the lives of migrant children. Constantly on the move, Amelia's family records events by crops not dates, carries with them only what will fit in the car, and are never anywhere long enough to feel at home. The girl longs for a place to stay, a place where she belongs. Teachers rarely bother to learn her name, so when Mrs. Ramos does so, it is special. The child's picture of a white house with a big shade tree earns a beautiful red star. On the way home, she discovers a road leading to a tree just like the one she drew. She visits this place often, and buries a small metal box filled with her treasures there when she must leave. For the first time in her life, Amelia has a home place. The acrylic-on-canvas illustrations have a folk-art quality that works well with this story. The canvas texture shows through the paint to add an almost tactile roughness of hard labor while rich colors capture the harvest crops at their succulent best. An important title for any library serving migrant populations, Amelia's Road should be a welcome addition almost anywhere.

My mother kept an orderly, clean house. She drove us to school every day and cooked dinner every night. She was a proper lady, the kind of woman who never wore white after Labor Day, crossed her legs at the ankle, and expected her children to be well mannered and respectful. We said please and thank you. We never let the screen door slam. We knew how to set a dinner table. My mother was sweet and warm, and she knew how to make life fun for my brother Jeffrey and me even if there wasn't much money. She'd buy a bunch of beads and we'd sit by the fire making necklaces. We'd cover the kitchen table with newspaper and have crab legs like we used to when we lived in Virginia. There was laughing, singing, dancing, and playing dress-up. At bedtime, she cuddled me, held me, called me Laurabelle, my little snowflake, my baby girl. These are the things that a mother does, and we expected them. Five days a week. But when Friday rolled around, everything changed.</p><p>Weekends, we entered another world. My dad, John Phillips, was a rock star, the leader and songwriter of the Mamas &amp; the Papas. The Mamas &amp; the Papas were huge in 1966. Their first album had just come out, and it was the number one album on the Billboard 200. Money poured in from hits like "Monday, Monday" and "California Dreamin'." Dad was fabulously rich and famous.</p><p>After school on Friday, a cavernous Fleetwood limo would glide down our street in Tarzana, a suburban neighborhood in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley. The limo would roll to a stop in front of our condo complex. I was six years old and my brother was seven. The neighborhood children would make thrones out of their hands and carry us to the car. As we climbed in, the kids would peer in the windows, hoping to get a glimpse of our father. He was never in the car. The engine purred, and we slid out of reality. The limo would transport us to either Dad's mansion in Bel Air or his mansion in the Malibu Colony, where our relatively stable childhood veered down a psychopharma rabbit hole.</p><p>I was conceived during a short reconciliation between my parents. As a little girl I hardly lived with my father. My dad had ditched my mother for a sixteen-year-old girl named Michelle when I was two, maybe younger. In the next few years Mom began to work at the Pentagon to support the three of us -- herself, my brother, and me. There wasn't a lot of money, we lived in a small apartment in Alexandria, Virginia, and my mom dated a lot. Every Sunday we had dinner, either at my grandmother Dini's or at my aunt Rosie's. Meanwhile, Dad and his new wife, Michelle Phillips, became famous with the Mamas &amp; the Papas practically overnight and lived a recklessly extravagant life.</p><p>Dad and Michelle made their home in Los Angeles, and eventually my mother moved there too, so now my parents were living in the same city, but in different worlds. Dad and Michelle's life felt like a fairy tale. She was beautiful and so young, the quintessential California girl. Dad was almost six foot six and dressed in handmade floor-length caftans and the like. He looked...like Jesus in tie-dye. On weekends Michelle took me clothes shopping at Bambola in Beverly Hills. She bought me tiny kid gloves in all different colors, dresses with matching coats, ankle socks, and Mary Janes. This alone was enough to make a princess out of me, but the dichotomy between my parents' lives was far bigger than being spoiled with clothes by Michelle. As soon as we drove through the massive wrought-iron gate of Bel Air, the contrast was mind-boggling. We were special. We were royalty.</p><p>My father was always surrounded by a noisy, outrageous, wild party. Rock 'n' roll stars, aristocracy, and Hollywood trash streamed in and out of his homes. He lived beyond his means. There were eight Rolls-Royces in the driveway and two Ferraris. The house was full of priceless antiques, but if something broke, it never got fixed. The housekeeper hadn't been paid, or she was fucking my father. There was a cook, but nobody shopped for food. The house was complete chaos, a bizarre mix of excess and oblivion, luxury and incompetence. I swam naked at midnight in the pool or the ocean and scrounged for dinner. I chased the pet peacocks around the estate grounds and had no idea what I might hear or see on any given night.</p><p>At the house in Bel Air my brother and I shared a room with twin beds. One night we awoke to hear Dad and Michelle making some kind of ruckus. It surpassed the everyday level of ruckus, so we sat up in bed and started calling for them, "Hey! What's going on?"</p><p>Michelle came into the room. She said, "Don't worry, your father and I were just playing." She was carrying a long stick with metal stubs poking out of it. Jeffrey and I looked at each other. This was no innocent game of Monopoly. Years later I channel-surfed past a show about cowboys and recognized the weird stick Michelle had been holding that night. It was a cattle prod. They were chasing each other around with a cattle prod. That may have been an isolated bizarre incident. But life then seemed to be nothing but a long, continuous series of isolated bizarre incidents, so much weirdness every day that the weirdness became everyday.</p><p>The Mamas &amp; the Papas played the Hollywood Bowl, a famous amphitheater smack in the middle of Hollywood. It was the Mamas &amp; the Papas' first formal live gig. Michelle decided to commemorate the event by piercing my ears. I was seven years old, compliant -- a perfect dress-up doll for Michelle. She sat me on the bedroom floor and gathered a sewing needle, pink thread, ice, and a wine cork. Holding the wine cork behind my ear to protect my neck, she forced the threaded needle through my ear, and then tied little peacock feathers (from the pet peacocks) to the ends of the pink threads. Michelle had assembled her tools so thoughtfully and executed the procedure so calmly -- which was even more impressive when I later found out she was on acid at the time.</p><p>Barry McGuire, who sang "Eve of Destruction," was coming with us to the Bowl. He was dressed in a cream-colored suit, but he couldn't find his shoes, so he painted his feet green. If I'd been a few years older I certainly would have figured out that they were all either on acid or, like me, following the lead of those who were.</p><p>The Hollywood Bowl show is fuzzy. I was really young. I remember screaming, "Dad! Dad!" from the audience. Later, backstage, I met Jimi Hendrix. Jimi Hendrix didn't mean much to me -- he had not yet ignited his guitar onstage at the Monterey Pop Festival, which my father would organize. A giant purple velvet hat floats in my consciousness, attached to the name Hendrix, a vague visual footnote, my own purple haze.</p><p>My mother flipped out when she saw that my virgin earlobes had been violated. Pearl studs at eighteen was more her cup of tea. Plus, the threads weren't big enough for earrings and I had to have my ears repierced, and the holes were completely crooked and have been my whole life. For all the asymmetry of my childhood, I'm still disproportionately pissed off about that.</p><p>It was a double life: doing what was expected at my mother's, and not answering to anyone at my dad's. I always was aware of the effect my father had on my mom. Even in my seven-year-old brain, I was aware that she was envious, angry, and sad. Often sad. I worried as much as a child can, but the fun at my dad's was irresistible. There was music, guitars, parties, rock stars, and the very seductive attitude of "We're all kids here." I'd ask my dad, "Can I go play on the beach?" and he'd say, "Whatever turns you on, kid." So I'd burst out the back door, free, a crazy kid chasing the dogs on the beach until we were all worn out. Occasionally the cook would attempt to impose a modicum of order. She'd say, "Now, young lady, you clean your room. Your dad's going to be mad," and I'd say, "No, he's not." How could he when he lived so wild? Meanwhile, in Tarzana, my mom was watching me walk down the street, yelling after me to tuck in my shirt. She was trying her best to raise her kids, but we were being shown another kind of life, and it was no competition. Would you rather live at Disneyland or in a condo in Tarzana? Being at Dad's was like riding the Matterhorn all day long, and the weekends, by moment and memory, dominated the school week.</p><p>My dad's friends never treated me like a child, not exactly. I was more like an accessory, a cute little prop who might amuse or entertain. One weekend before we'd moved to Los Angeles from Virginia -- I must have been five or six -- we were with Dad in L.A. for a visit. His fellow band member Cass Eliot (the other "Mama") had a party at her house in Laurel Canyon. We walked into Cass's house and there were Paul McCartney and George Harrison.</p><p>When I saw Paul McCartney I glommed on to him like a baby groupie. He kept saying, "Go on, love, get up and dance." In a rare moment of shyness, I demurred. I was afraid people would laugh at me. He insisted. I refused. This exchange circled, a teasing game between a little kid and a world-famous musician.</p><p>Finally I broke down and started dancing. The adults began to point and laugh at the little five-year-old dancing for the rock star. I turned bright red and burst into tears, but then Paul McCartney started consoling me. I was no dummy. I liked being consoled by Paul McCartney. The more he comforted, the more tears I summoned. Finally he picked me up and carried me into a hammock that was suspended in the middle of Cass's dining room on a pulley. Someone hoisted us up, up, up. The ceilings were two stories tall and we were suspended fifteen feet in the air. I was still snuffling. Paul snuggled up with me until I finally calmed down and eventually fell asleep. The two of us napped together in that hammock, suspended high above the party. You could say I got high and slept with Paul McCartney.</p><p>There was something about my father.

She loved lying there, listening to the bees, smelling the flowers, and helping herself to an apple from the orchards. She lived in a safe, protected world, surrounded by people who loved her. And she particularly loved running free in the summer. She had lived at the Chateau de Marmouton for all of her eleven years, and roamed its woods and hills like a young doe, wading ankle deep in the little stream that ran through it. There were horses and cows, and a proper barnyard on the lower property at the old farmhouse. The men who worked the farm always smiled and waved when they saw her. She was a laughing, happy child, and a free spirit. And most of the time, as she wandered through the tall grass, or picked apples and peaches in the orchard, she was barefoot.<br><br>"You look like a little gypsy!" her mother scolded her, but she always smiled when she said it. Francoise Hawkins adored both her children.<br><br>Her son Robert had been born shortly after the war, eleven months after she married John Hawkins. John had started his business, exporting wine, at the same time, and within five years, he had made an immense amount of money. They had bought the Chateau de Marmouton when Marie-Ange was born, and she had grown up there. She went to the local school in the village, the same lycee that Robert had attended. And now, in a month, he was leaving for the Sorbonne, in Paris. He was going to study economics, and eventually work in his father's business. The business had grown by leaps and bounds, and John himself was amazed at how successful it had become, and how comfortable they were as a result of it. Francoise was very proud of him. She always had been. Theirs was a remarkable and romantic story.<br><br>In the last months of the war, as an American soldier, John had been parachuted into France, and broken a leg when he landed in a tree on Francoise's parents' small farm. She and her mother had been there alone, her father was in the Resistance, and had been out at one of the secret meetings he attended nearly every night. They had hidden John in the attic. Francoise had been sixteen then, and more than a little dazzled by John's tall, midwestern good looks and charm. He was a farm boy himself and only four years older than she was. <br><br>Her mother had kept a watchful eye on them, afraid that Francoise would fall in love with him and do something foolish. But John had been respectful of her, and as much in love eventually as Francoise was. She taught him French, and he taught her English, in their whispered conversations at night, in the pitch black of the attic. They had never dared to light so much as a candle, for fear that the Germans would see them. He had stayed with them for four months, and by the time he left, Francoise was heartbroken over his going. Her father and some of his friends from the Resistance had spirited him back to the Americans, and he had eventually taken part in the liberation of Paris. But he had promised Francoise he would come back for her, and she knew without a doubt that he would.<br><br>Her parents were killed in the final days just before the liberation, and she was sent to Paris to live with cousins. She had no way of reaching John, his address had been lost in the chaos, and she had no idea he was in Paris. Long afterward, they learned that they had been within a mile or two of each other most of the time, as she lived just off the Boulevard Saint-Germain, and he never knew it.<br><br>John was shipped back to the States before seeing her again, and returned to Iowa. He had his own family worries. His father had been killed in Guam, and he had to take care of his own family's farm with his mother, sisters, and brothers. He wrote to Francoise as soon as he got back, but his letters were neither returned, nor answered. They never reached her. And it was a full two years before he had saved up enough money to go back to France, to see if he could find her. He had been obsessed with her since he left. And when he reached the farm where they had met, he found that it had been sold and was inhabited by strangers. And all the neighbors knew was that Francoise's parents were dead and she had gone to Paris.<br><br>He went there next, and used every resource he could think of to find her, the police, the Red Cross, the registry at the Sorbonne, as many local schools as he could visit. And on the day before he was to leave, sitting in a small cafe on the Left Bank, as though by a miracle, he saw her, walking slowly along the street in the rain, with her head down. At first, he thought it was a stranger who just looked like Francoise, but as he glanced at her more closely, and then ran after her, feeling foolish, but knowing he had to try one last time, she burst into tears the moment she saw him and threw her arms around him.<br><br>They spent the evening together at her cousins' home, and he left for the States the following morning. They corresponded for a year after that, and then he finally returned to Paris, to stay this time. She was nineteen, and he was twenty-three by then, and they were married two weeks after he got back to Paris. In the ensuing years, nineteen of them, they had never left each other for a moment. They left Paris after Robert was born, and John eventually said he felt more at home in France than he ever had living in Iowa with his parents. It was meant to be, they always said, as they smiled at each other whenever they told their story. Marie-Ange had heard the tale a thousand times, and people always said it was very romantic.<br><br>Marie-Ange had never met her father's relatives. His parents had died before she was born, and both his brothers. A sister had died a few years before, and his other sister was killed in an accident when Marie-Ange was a baby. His only surviving relative was an aunt on his father's side, but Marie-Ange could tell from the way her father talked about her that he didn't like her. None of his relatives had ever come to France, and he had said more than once that they thought he was crazy when he moved to Paris to be with her mother. <br><br>Francoise's cousins had died in an accident when Marie-Ange was three, she had no grandparents, and her mother had no brothers or sisters. The only family Marie-Ange had were her brother Robert, and her parents, and a great-aunt somewhere in Iowa, whom her father hated. He had explained to Marie-Ange once that she was "mean-spirited and small-minded," whatever that meant. They no longer even corresponded. But Marie-Ange felt no lack of family. Her life was full, and the people in it treated her like a blessing and a joy, and even her name said she was an angel. Everyone thought of her that way, even her brother Robert, who loved to tease her.<br><br>She was going to miss him when he went away, but Francoise had already promised Marie-Ange that she would take her to Paris to see him often. John had business there, and he and Francoise loved going to Paris for a night or two away. Usually when they did, they left Marie-Ange with Sophie, the elderly housekeeper who had been with them since Robert was a baby. She had come to the chateau with them, and lived in a little house on the property. Marie-Ange loved to visit her, and sip tea and eat the cookies that Sophie baked for her.<br><br>Marie-Ange's life was perfect in every way. She had the kind of childhood that most people dreamed of. Freedom, love, security, and she lived in a beautiful old chateau, like a little princess. And when her mother dressed her in the pretty dresses she bought in Paris for her, she even looked like one. Or so her father told her. Though when she ran barefoot through the fields, in the dresses and smocks she tore while climbing trees, he loved to say that she looked like an orphan.<br><br>"So, little one, what mischief are you up to today?" her brother asked when he came to find her for lunch. Sophie had gotten too old to chase after her, and their mother had sent Robert to find her, as he often did. He knew all her favorite haunts and hiding places.<br><br>"Nothing." She had peaches smeared all over her face, and her pockets were full of peach pits as she smiled at him. He was tall and handsome and blond, like their father, as was Marie-Ange. She had blond curls, and blue eyes, and the face of an angel. Only Francoise had dark hair and big velvety brown eyes, and her husband often said that he wished they had another child, who looked just like her. But there was a lot of Francoise's sense of mischief and fun in Marie-Ange's spirit.<br><br>"Maman says it's time for you to come in for lunch," Robert said, shepherding her like a young colt. He didn't want to admit it to her, but he knew how much he would miss her when he went to Paris. Ever since she could walk, she had been his shadow.<br><br>"I'm not hungry," the child said, grinning at him.<br><br>"Of course not, you eat fruit all day. It's amazing you don't get a stomachache from it."<br><br>"Sophie says it's good for me."<br><br>"So is lunch. Come on, Papa will be home any minute. You have to come and wash your face, and put some shoes on." He took her by the hand, and she followed him back to the house, teasing and playing, and running around him like a puppy.<br><br>And when her mother saw her, she groaned at what the child looked like. "Marie-Ange," she said to her in French. Only John spoke to Marie-Ange in English, and she was surprisingly proficient, although she had an accent. "That was a new dress you put on this morning. It's in shreds now." Francoise rolled her eyes, but she never looked angry. Most of the time, she was amused by her daughter's antics.<br><br>"No, Maman, it's just the pinafore that's torn. The dress is still all right," Marie-Ange reassured her with a sheepish grin.<br><br>"Thank Heaven for small favors. Now go and wash your face and hands, and put shoes on. Sophie will help you." The old woman in the frayed black dress and clean apron followed Marie-Ange out of the kitchen, and upstairs to her room on the top floor of the chateau. It wasn't easy for her to get around anymore, but she would have gone to the ends of the earth for her "baby." She had cared for Robert when he was born, and had been overjoyed when Marie-Ange came as a surprise seven years later. She loved the entire Hawkins family as though they had been her children. She had a daughter of her own, but she lived in Normandy and they seldom saw each other. Sophie would never have admitted it, but she was far more devoted to the Hawkins children than she had ever been to her own daughter. And like Marie-Ange, she was sad that Robert was leaving them and going to study in Paris. But she knew it would be good for him, and she would see him when he came home for holidays and vacations.<br><br>John had talked briefly about sending his son to the States to study for a year, but Francoise didn't like the idea, and Robert himself had finally admitted that he didn't want to go so far away. They were a close-knit family, and he had a vast number of friends in the region. Paris was far enough away for him, and like his mother, and sister, he was profoundly French, in spite of his American father.<br><br>John was seated at the kitchen table by the time Marie-Ange came downstairs. Francoise had just poured him a glass of wine, and a smaller one for Robert. They drank wine at every meal, and sometimes they gave Marie-Ange a few drops in a glass of water. John had adapted easily and well to French customs. He had conducted his business in French for years, but spoke to his children in English so they would learn the language. And Robert was far more fluent than his sister.<br><br>The conversation at lunch was as lively as usual. John and Robert spoke about business, while Francoise commented on various bits of local news, and made sure that Marie-Ange didn't make a mess while she was eating. Although she was allowed to roam the fields, her education had been a formal one, and she had extremely good manners, when she chose to use them.<br><br>"And you, little one, what have you done today?" her father asked her, tousling her curls with one hand, while Francoise served him a cup of strong, steaming filtered coffee.<br><br>"She's been stripping your orchards, Papa," Robert said, laughing at her, and Marie-Ange looked from one to the other with amusement.<br><br>"Robert says eating too many peaches will give me a stomachache, but it doesn't," she said proudly. "I'm going to visit the farm later," she said, like a young queen planning to visit her subjects. Marie-Ange had never met anyone she didn't like, nor anyone who found her less than enchanting. She was the proverbial golden child, and Robert especially loved her. Because of the seven-year gap in their age, there had never been any jealousy between them.<br><br>"You're going to have to go back to school soon," her father reminded her. "The vacation is almost over." But the reminder made Marie-Ange frown. She knew that it meant Robert would be leaving, and when the time came, they all knew it would be hard for her, and for him as well, although he was excited by the adventure of living in Paris.<br><br>They had found him a small apartment on the Left Bank, and his mother was going to settle him in before they left him to his studies. She had already sent several pieces of furniture and trunks ahead, all of which were waiting for him in Paris.<br><br>When the big day finally came for Robert to leave, Marie-Ange got out of bed at dawn and was hiding in the orchard when Robert came looking for her before breakfast.</p><h2>Embracing the Uncertain: 40 Devotions for Unsteady Times</h2><p><p>Just turning on the news lets us know we are living in uncertain times.

It was a peaceful, beautiful little fief, far from the dangerous feudal petty squabbles of the Five Duchies, on the world of Callidore. There were cows. Lots of cows. And cheese. For six months things went well: he found a quaint little shop, befriended the local lord, the village folk loved him, he found a sharp young apprentice to help out, and best yet, he met a comely young widow with the prettiest eyes . . . Then one night Minalan is forced to pick up his mageblade again to defend his adopted home from the vanguard of an army of goblins &#x2013; gurvani, they call themselves &#x2013; bent on a genocidal crusade against all mankind. And that was the good news. The bad news was that their shamans were armed with more magical power than has been seen since the days of the ancient Imperial Magocracy &#x2013; and their leader, a mysterious, vengeful force of hate and dark magic, is headed directly to Boval Vale, along with a massive invading army of gurvani. The good people of Boval and their spellmonger have only one choice: to hole up in the over-sized Boval Castle and hope they can endure a siege against hundreds of thousands of goblins. When the people look to him for hope, Minalan does his best, but the odds are depressing: there are multitudes of goblins, and they want Boval Vale as a staging ground for a vengeful invasion of the whole Five Duchies. Add to his troubles a jealous rival mage, a motley band of mercenaries, a delusional liege lord who insists victory is at hand despite the hordes at his door, a dour castellan, a moody, pregnant girlfriend and a catty ex-girlfriend who specializes in sex magic - all trapped in a stinking, besieged castle with no hope of rescue, and you&#x2019;ll understand why Minalan is willing to take his chances with the goblins. All that stands between the gurvani horde and the people of the Five Duchies is one tired, overwhelmed baker&#x2019;s son who wanted nothing more than to be a simple village spellmonger!</p><p>Terry Mancour is a New York Times best-selling author who lives in Durham, North Carolina with his beautiful wife, three precocious children, and his vivid imagination.

Advice from Olympic Champion and Olympic Coach, Lanny Bassham</p><p>In 1972, at the Munich Germany Olympic Games, Lanny Bassham failed in his attempt to win the Gold Medal in International Rifle Shooting. He had a mental failure resulting in his taking the Silver instead. Frustrated, Lanny wanted to take a course in controlling the mind under pressure. After looking for such a seminar and not finding satisfaction, Bassham began to interview Olympic Gold Medalists to discover what they were doing differently to win. What he discovered was truly remarkable. Bassham created a system of mental control he called Mental Management�. Within the next 6 years, Lanny Bassham dominated his sport, winning 22 world individual and team titles, setting 4 world records and winning the coveted Olympic Gold Medal in Montreal in 1976.For the past 40 years, Lanny has been teaching Mental Management� to Olympians, business owners, Fortune 500 Corporations and the elite of sport and business community. His clients include the PGA and PGA tour players, Miss America finalists, Miss USA winners, World and Olympic champions, Fortune 500 companies, The United States Secret Service, The US Navy SEALS, The United States Army Marksmanship Unit, and Olympic teams of USA, Canada, India, Japan, Republic of China, Korea and Australia.As a parent and a student of Lanny Bassham, this book is a must-read for any parent who wants their children to be happy, confident and successful in life. Brandon Webb, former US Navy SEAL and New York Times bestselling author of The Red Circle --Brandon Webb - New York Times bestselling author of The Red Circle<br><br>Lanny - I just finished reading your book "Parenting Champions". As a level 3 JOAD archery coach I was looking for a way to get your mental management tools to the parents of my athletes. This book has really answered the call. I read it to see if it was something the parents of my athletes would benefit from, I guess I should have known coming from you it would be. In fact, I am so pleased with it, I have recommended it not just to my parents, but that they have their athlete read also, as well as my other coaches and instructors. What a great tool for anyone working with young athletes. As with all your tools, this will help me be a better coach, my athletes will improve their mental game, and parents will learn how to help their young athlete grow their skills through a positive self-image program. This book in concert with your Performance Journal, (which I insist all my competitive archers use) will truly enhance their training and progression.

Can you believe that in colonial days, window-washing rags were dipped in pee? Or that snail slime was once an ingredient in cough syrup? Stink has a nose for yuck and muck, and this book is full of it: moose poop festivals, mouse brain toothpaste, maggot cheese, and way more. Its pages are crawling with more than two hundred facts, quizzes, recipes, and bits of trivia about things that are gross, bad, and smelly.

The short volume covers such topics as edible insects, laws concerning underwear, slime, weird things that people around the world eat, mummies, skin shedding, and other items that turn the stomach and are endlessly fascinating to most young people, especially boys.

It can be hard and ugly. Hurt, frustration and regret can make everything seem hopeless. But, God has a plan for everything in our lives. He offers unconditional love and grace, despite our imperfections. He offers hope where we see only despair. Discover the repurposed and upcycled life. This is a life where no experience is wasted. Like the best trash-to-treasure decorating project, it's a life where God repurposes our junky experiences. It's where he upcycles -&nbsp;turns hopeless situations into something so much better than we ever imagined -&nbsp;when we let him work with the trash. When we surrender to his leading, God demonstrates his creativity in revealing how our greatest disappointments, mistakes, and painful experiences can be priceless treasures.&nbsp;</p><p>Through humor and stories, Michelle Rayburn addresses how to unpack emotional baggage and let go of the past.

Years ago, she left her career as a registered nurse to raise her family, and along the way, she discovered her true passion for writing, speaking, and singing. Along that path of discovery, she tried many side ventures, including: a wedding coordinator, rubber stamp demonstrator, custom painter and decorator, craft instructor, craft seller, and web designer. Pile on her hobbies as a quilter, scrapbooker, and avid reader, and that&#39;s a lot of dots to connect! For the sake of sanity, she has exchanged most of those roles for the thrill of putting words on paper. Michelle lives in an unusual home that was formerly a little country church with a parsonage attached. The church half of it is a hundred years old, and the rest is gradually coming out of the dreadful 50s and 70s decor with ongoing updates and renovation. She loves trash-to-treasure decorating and has filled her home with creative makeovers of &#34;junk.&#34; As a wife and a mom of two boys, Michelle&#39;s hidden motive as a speaker for women&#39;s events is the welcome escape from the testosterone zone to get a good dose of estrogen and female companionship.Michelle Rayburn offers great grins right alongside a sweet biblical boost.

Her transparency and sense of humor help make this book at once meaningful, challenging, and fun...as charming as the antique door she's repurposed as a room divider. Her gift for finding new purposes for items that seem to have lost their usefulness is more than equaled by her gift for applying that principle to life's difficulties and disappointments in this treasure of a book.&nbsp;<br><b>--Cynthia Ruchti</b>,&nbsp;novelist, speaker, and author of&nbsp;<i>Ragged Hope: Surviving the Fallout of Other People's Choices,&nbsp;Tattered and Mended, Miles from Where We Started, </i>and more.<br>Michelle had me laughing from the first paragraph in her intro.

This debut thriller--the first in a trilogy from the late Stieg Larsson--is a serious page-turner rivaling the best of Charlie Huston and Michael Connelly. Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch--and there's always a catch--is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really <em>don't</em> want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo. --<em>Dave Callanan</em><br><br>Stieg Larsson was the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine Expo. He was a leading expert on anti-democratic, right-wing extremist organisations. He died in 2004, soon after delivering the text of the novels that make up the Millennium Trilogy.</p><h2>Tales of Sasha 1: The Big Secret</h2><p>In the first book of the <i>Tales of Sasha</i> series, a young horse named Sasha discovers a big secret about what makes her different from her friends and family.<br><br>Sasha has always felt a little bit different from the other horses in her home of Verdant Valley. She loves running and jumping and the feeling of being in the air, and she longs to explore the forest beyond her valley. <br><br>One day during class, the white patch on Sasha's back gives her an itching feeling that makes her want to <i>soar</i>, and she leaps over a big rock. When she lands, she realizes that her patch is sparkling! But what does it mean?

Sasha isn't like the other horses in her herd. She loves running and craves adventure more than the others, especially her ladylike older sisters. She struggles in school with an "itchy feeling" of anticipation, which leaves her fidgety, unable to stay still or pay attention. As much as she tries to behave, she can't fight her desire to run and jump-especially to jump. When the white patch on her back, the itching's source, begins to sparkle, she goes to her parents for answers and gets more than she expected. Sasha was adopted; she joined their family as a newborn when, during a huge thunderstorm, a blast of sparkling rainbow lightning left Sasha behind with a letter asking her parents to take care of her. Wanting to know more, Sasha and her best friend go hiking at the mountain where her parents found her. Near the top of the mountain, an accidentally-too-enthusiastic jump launches Sasha off the mountain-whereupon she sprouts wings from her white patch and flies. Energetic readers will relate to Sasha's manic, kinetic energy and envy her flight abilities. The sequel, &lt;i&gt;Journey Beyond the Trees&lt;/i&gt;, releasing simultaneously, continues bold Sasha's quest for answers as she travels in search of her kind. Gentle black-and-white art emphasizes the horses' expressive eyes and manes. Sweet and spunky. (Fantasy. 6-8), <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>This first book in the Tales of Sasha series focuses on a horse who doesn't fit in with her fellow equines. Sasha loves to run and longs to explore beyond the confines of Verdant Valley. Her displacement begins to make more sense after her parents reveal that they originally found her during a rainstorm-and after she sprouts giant wings from her back. Smoothly incorporated into each page, Sordo's black-and-white artwork (not all seen by PW) has a fresh, cartoony look that feels squarely aimed at fans of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. The story's straightforward language is well-crafted for beginning readers, and what the story lacks in humor it makes up for with adventure, particularly during Sasha's accidental plunge off a mountain when her wings make their first appearance.

In this book, Kandinsky compares the spiritual life of humanity to a pyramid; and the artist has the mission of leading others to the top.</p><p><p>A pioneering work in the movement to free art from its traditional bonds to material reality, this book is one of the most important documents in the history of modern art. Written by the famous nonobjective painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866&#x2013;1944), it explains Kandinsky's own theory of painting and crystallizes the ideas that were influencing many other modern artists of the period. Along with his own groundbreaking paintings, this book had a tremendous impact on the development of modern art.<br>Kandinsky's ideas are presented in two parts. The first part, called "About General Aesthetic," issues a call for a spiritual revolution in painting that will let artists express their own inner lives in abstract, non-material terms. Just as musicians do not depend upon the material world for their music, so artists should not have to depend upon the material world for their art. In the second part, "About Painting," Kandinsky discusses the psychology of colors, the language of form and color, and the responsibilities of the artist. An Introduction by the translator, Michael T. H. Sadler, offers additional explanation of Kandinsky's art and theories, while a new Preface by Richard Stratton discusses Kandinsky's career as a whole and the impact of the book. Making the book even more valuable are nine woodcuts by Kandinsky himself that appear at the chapter headings.<br>This English translation of <i>�ber das Geistige in der Kunst</i> was a significant contribution to the understanding of nonobjectivism in art. It continues to be a stimulating and necessary reading experience for every artist, art student, and art patron concerned with the direction of 20th-century painting.</p><p></p>Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944) was a Russian painter, and art theorist. He is credited with painting the first modern abstract works. Born in Moscow, Kandinsky spent his childhood in Odessa. He enrolled at the University of Moscow and chose to study law and economics. Quite successful in his profession - he was offered a professorship (chair of Roman Law) at the University of Dorpat - he started painting studies (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 30. In 1896, he settled in Munich and studied first in the private school of Anton A&#x17e;be and then at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. He went back to Moscow in 1914, after World War I started. He was unsympathetic to the official theories on art in Moscow and returned to Germany in 1921. There, he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933. He then moved to France where he lived the rest of his life, and became a French citizen in 1939. He died at Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1944. His great-grandson, Anton S. Kandinsky, is also a New York-based artist working in a style called 'Gemism'.</p><h2>Puddle</h2><p>One rainy day, a little boy is upset because he can&#39;t go out and play.

He trusted to nothing but his weapons, his horse, and the caution with which he rode. <br><br>His hard-boned face was tanned to saddle leather under the beat-up, black, flat-crowned hat. He wore fringed shotgun chaps, a faded red shirt, a black handkerchief knotted about his throat, and a dozen scars of knife and bullet. <br><br>It was a baked and brutal land, this Sonora, sunblistered and arid, yet as he sifted his way through the stands of organ-pipe cactus, prickly pear and cat&#x2019;s claw, he knew the desert throbbed with its own strange life, and he knew those slim fingers of lifting smoke beckoned death. <br><br>He was a lone-riding man in a lonesome country, riding toward a destiny of which he knew nothing, a manwho for ten long years had known no other life than this, nor wished for any other.<br><br> What else there was he had known before, but now he lived from day to day, watching the lonely sunsets flame and die, bleeding their crimson shadows against the long, serrated ridges. Watching the dawns come, seeing the mornings stir with their first life . . . and the land he rode was a land where each living thing lived by the death of some other thing. <br><br>The desert was a school, a school where each day, each hour, a final examination was offered, where failure meant death and the buzzards landed to correct the papers. <br><br>For the desert holds no easy deaths . . . hard, bitter, and ugly are the desert deaths . . . and long drawn out. <br><br>Merciless were the raw-backed mountains, dreadfully desolate the canyons, the white-faced ancient lakes were dust . . . traps where a man might die, choking horribly upon alkali or the ashen powder of ancient rocks. <br><br>For seven days Shalako heard no sound but that of his own passage, and then a gunshot bought space in the silence, a harsh whiplash of sound, followed after an instant by the shattering volley of at least four rifles. <br><br>The rifles spoke again from the sounding board of the rocks, racketing away down the canyons to fade at the desert&#x2019;s rim. <br><br>Motionless upon a sun-baked slope, he waited while the sweat found thin furrows through the dust on his cheeks, but there was no further sound, no further shot, nor was there movement within the range of his vision . . . merely the lazy circle of a buzzard against the heatblurred sky. <br><br>If they had not seen him already they would not see&nbsp;him if he remained still, and Shalako had learned his patience in a hard school. <br><br>Movement attracts the eye, draws the attention, renders visible. A motionless object that blends with the surroundings can long remain invisible even when close by, and Shalako was not moving.<br><br>About him lay vast, immeasurable distances, pastel shadings of salmon, pink, and lemon broken by the deeper reds of rock or the darkness of cliff shadow. Overhead the sun was lost in a copper sky above the heatwaved reaches where all sharpness of outline melted in the shimmering movement of the air. <br><br>The innocent distance that lay before him was broken by hollows, canyons, folded hills, but it seemed an even, unbroken expanse from where he sat. There were cholla forests out there, scatterings of lava . . . a land where anything might be and something obviously was. <br><br>The notch in the hills toward which he was pointing held a pass through the mountains, and within the pass lay a water hole. His canteen was half-full and if necessity demanded it could be made to last another three days . . . it had done so before. In the desert a man learns to use water sparingly and to make a little cover a lot of distance. <br><br>The roan gelding was a mountain-bred horse and could survive on cholla or prickly pear if the spines were burned away, but water and grass lay within that opening in the hills, and Shalako had no intention of skirting the mountain unless circumstances insisted. Yet the sound of shots had come from that direction. <br><br>After a while he made, with sparing movements, a cigarette, his eyes holding on the far, blue mountains briefly, then surveying the country while he worked with the&nbsp;small, essential movements. He considered the possibilities, knowing that a desert offers less freedom of movement than at first seems likely. All travel in the desert, of man or animal, is governed by the need for water. Some animals learned to survive for days without water, but man was not one of these.</p><h2>Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East (Volume One)</h2><p>2010 Reprint of 1924 Edition. In 1924 Spalding published this first and most important volume of Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East. It describes the travels to India and Tibet of a research party of eleven scientists in 1894. During their trip they claim to have made contact with &#34;the Great Masters of the Himalayas&#34;, immortal beings with whom they lived and studied, gaining a fascinating insight into their lives and spiritual message. This close contact enabled them to witness many of the spiritual principles evinced by these Great Masters translated into their everyday lives, which could be described as &#39;miracles&#39;. Such examples are walking on water, or manifesting bread to feed the hungry party. These books have remained consistently popular with spiritual seekers, those interested in the philosophy of the East and those who enjoy a good story because of their accessible nature and easy-to-follow format. However, despite most of the action taking place in India, the Great Masters make it clear that the greatest embodiment of the Enlightened state is that of the Christ (as personified by Jesus): &#34;The Masters accept that Buddha represents the Way to Enlightenment, but they clearly set forth that Christ IS Enlightenment, or a state of consciousness for which we are all seeking - the Christ light of every individual; therefore, the light of every child born into the world.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Unstoppable Garrett Morgan</h2><p><p><em>"If a man puts something to block your way, the first time you go around it, the second time you go over it, and the third time you go through it."</em></p><p>Living by these words made inventor and entrepreneur Garrett Morgan unstoppable!

Underlying the story is the disclosure by the Mother of Jesus that she will never come to earth again in apparition. <i>THE LAST APPARITION</i> is a must read!</p><p>About the author: <br>Wayne Weible has authored nine books on his experiences and investigations of the reported apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the village of Medjugorje, all which have become international best sellers. His first book--Medjugorje: The Message, has sold more than 500,000 copies in the U.S. and an estimated 500,000 in other languages around the world. This is the top selling book internationally on the Medjugorje apparitions.<br> Weible is a former newspaper publisher and columnist. He became interested in the alleged apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to six young Croations in the tiny farming village of Medjugorje in Bosnia-Hercegovina, in October 1985. Weible decided to write an article about them for his four weekly newspapers. It was while viewing a video tape of the apparitions as research for the article that Weible, a Protestant at that time, states, I suddenly felt a strong message within my heart that not only was I to write about these events, but I was to devote my life to the spreading of its basic message of reconciliation with God.<br> The Miracle At Medjugorje, a collection of a series of newspaper articles, was originally published in Sept. 1986. From an initial printing of 3,000 copies, Miracle At Medjugorje distribution has reached an astounding 100 million-plus copies and is still distributed throughout the world. Weible Columns, Inc. continues to publish The Medjugorje Newsletter monthly. <br> Weible spends most of his professional time writing and lecturing on the phenomenon of Medjugorje, travelling throughout the world and the United States. He has appeared on numerous national, regional and local television and radio programs including the Mother Angelica Television Show, and the Oprah Winfrey Show. Weible has traveled to Medjugorje more than 100 times and continues to lead groups each year. He is personally acquainted with all of the visionaries. In 1991, he converted to the Roman Catholic Church; however, he continues to emphasize that The message coming from the Virgin Mary in Medjugorje is for all faiths, not just for Catholics--or for that matter just for Christians. Weible is married and lives with his wife in Hiawassee, Georgia. He is a graduate of the University of South Carolina, with a degree in Journalism.What an incredible book about the love of the Blessed Mother for her children.

Through lessons from Strickland's own life experiences and those of countless others who have overcome challenging circumstances and turned their lives around, <i>Make the Impossible Possible </i>teaches us how to build on our passions and strengths, dream bigger and set the bar higher, achieve meaningful success, and inspire the lives of others.</p><p>BILL STRICKLAND is CEO of Manchester Bidwell, a jobs training center and community arts program. At Manchester Craftsmen Guild, he offers programs in ceramics, photography, and painting to hundreds of kids a year, ninety percent of whom get high school diplomas and enroll in college. And at the Bidwell Training Center, adults receive training in professional careers such as the culinary arts, pharmacology, and horticultural technology, through partnerships with major corporations in the area. The center includes a 350-seat jazz auditorium, a 40,000-square-foot greenhouse covering half a city block, a state-of-the-art chemistry lab, a full-scale ceramics department, and a culinary institute. As a result of his work, Strickland has received a MacArthur Fellowship &#x201c;genius&#x201d; grant, has lectured at Harvard Graduate School of Education, has served on the board of the National Endowment for the Arts, and he and Manchester Bidwell have been the subject of three Harvard Business School case studies. He lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<b>CHAPTER ONE<br>From the Ghetto to Harvard Business School<br></b><br><br>It was a winter morning in 1996 and I was standing center stage in the pit of a jam-packed, wood-paneled lecture hall at Harvard University. Rows of wooden seats loomed above me in curving tiers. In those seats, with their expectant gazes bearing down on me, sat about one hundred razor-sharp young men and women&#x2013;graduate students at the Harvard Business School&#x2013;waiting to see what I had to offer. As a result of my work with inner-city kids and adults at the Manchester Bidwell Center in Pittsburgh, I had been asked to serve as an HBS case study, to share a little hard-earned business savvy from the other side of the tracks. <br><br>As Professor Jim Heskett introduced me to his class, I positioned my beat-up old slide projector on a tabletop, then opened a battered cardboard box, held together with duct tape at the corners, and lifted out a loaded carousel of slides. The students looked me over. In recent weeks, such other speakers as Disney honcho Michael Eisner and Southwest Airlines chief Herb Kelleher had stood where I was standing to share their business philosophies and reveal their secrets of success. Now it was my turn in the spotlight. I knew the kids weren&#x2019;t sure what to expect from me. To tell the truth, I wasn&#x2019;t so sure that they could get what I had to offer. After all, I don&#x2019;t run an airline or an entertainment empire. If you wanted to be technical about it, you could say I&#x2019;m not a businessman at all. As the founder and CEO of Manchester Bidwell, a community arts-education and jobtraining center in Pittsburgh, my mission is to turn people&#x2019;s lives around. We do that by offering them two distinct educational programs under the same roof. The first program, which we call the Manchester Craftsmen&#x2019;s Guild, offers rigorous after-school courses in the arts that light a creative fire in at-risk kids and inspire them to stay in school. Classes at the Craftsmen&#x2019;s Guild are taught by a staff of established artists and skilled instructors, and the curriculum is designed to rival courses taught at the best private schools and academies. Our center also houses the Bidwell Training Center, which provides state-of-the-art job-training programs intended to give poor and otherwise disadvantaged adults the skills and direction they need to land meaningful, good-paying jobs that provide the foundation for a much brighter future. Our students include welfare mothers, recovering addicts, ex-convicts, laid-off manufacturing workers, and others who have had hope or even dignity snatched away by the difficult circumstances of their lives. Our younger students at the Craftsmen&#x2019;s Guild face similar struggles. Many of them are on a fast track to failure when they come to us, flunking courses, skipping school, on the verge of dropping out or being suspended. Some of them swagger in, angry, defiant, bristling with hostile attitude. Others hide behind a prickly shell of apathy and withdrawal.<br><br>When we started out some twenty years ago, most of our students were African-Americans from the city&#x2019;s poorest neighborhoods. Today, almost half our student body is made up of disadvantaged white folks.We greet them all with the same basic recipe for success: high standards, stiff challenges, a chance to develop unexplored talents, and a message that many of them haven&#x2019;t heard before&#x2013;that no matter how difficult the circumstances of their lives may be, no matter how many bad assumptions they&#x2019;ve made about their chances in life, no matter how well they&#x2019;ve been taught to rein in their dreams and narrow their aspirations, they have the right, and the potential, to expect to live rich and satisfying lives. It takes some time for them to adjust to that message and trust our faith in their potential, but once they do, the transformation is remarkable, and our success rates, compiled over more than twenty years, show that we must be doing something right.<br><br>More than 90 percent of the kids who come to us get their high school diplomas and 85 percent enroll in college or some other form of higher education. Our job-training programs for disadvantaged adults are yielding similar successes: Almost 80 percent of our adult students complete their vocational training and 86 percent of them find employment after graduation. And I&#x2019;m not talking about flipping burgers. These are good, substantial jobs&#x2013;as sous chefs, chemical and pharmaceutical technicians, and the like&#x2013;jobs that can lift an entire family out of poverty and personal inertia, and offer a real chance at a stable and rewarding future. <br><br>The success of Manchester Bidwell has won us a lot of respect and support from the business community across the country, and it has helped us forge dynamic corporate partnerships with companies like IBM, Alcoa, PPG Industries, Heinz, Hewlett-Packard, Bayer, Mylan Labs, Nova Chemicals, and many more. Leading figures in politics, education, and the arts have also singled us out for praise (we&#x2019;re one of very few programs, I&#x2019;m sure, ever to draw the enthusiastic support of both Hillary Clinton and prominent conservative Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania), and our work here has brought me a humbling litany of honors and personal recognition. I&#x2019;ve been appointed to the National Council on the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the President&#x2019;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. Two presidents have summoned me to the White House to discuss our operations, and ten universities have awarded me honorary Ph.D.&#x2019;s. In 1999, the MacArthur Foundation gave me one of their famous &#x201c;genius grants,&#x201d; and I am now a trustee at the University of Pittsburgh, the school that had to be coaxed to accept me as a probationary student thirty-four years ago. Along with my staff, I&#x2019;ve also received some remarkable attention from the world of music in recognition of the jazz program that has evolved at the center as part of the innovative mix that gives the place its creative spirit. Since 1987, Manchester Bidwell has hosted a live jazz concert series, which draws the top jazz artists in the world to perform here, in the intimate music hall that is part of our facility. Our music program, one of the oldest and most successful jazz subscription series in the country, has made Manchester Bidwell one of the most highly regarded jazz venues in the nation, and it has also spawned our own recording label&#x2013;MCG Jazz&#x2013;which produces and distributes jazz albums by some of the premier jazz artists on the planet, including Nancy Wilson, The Count Basie Orchestra, the New York Voices, and Brazilian superstar Ivan Lins. The quality of our recordings has been validated again and again by the music industry: Seven of our releases have been nominated for Grammy Awards in various jazz categories, and four of those nominated albums brought Grammys home to Manchester.<br><br>All this unlikely and unexpected recognition has created an ever-widening ripple of interest in our operations, and for years I&#x2019;ve been crisscrossing the country, sharing the Manchester Bidwell story with anyone who will listen&#x2013;at conferences and seminars everywhere, with audiences that include influential leaders in the fields of business, education, government, and the arts, from laid-back, denim-clad technology tycoons in the Silicon Valley to the prim and pious parishioners of evangelist Robert Schuller&#x2019;s Crystal Cathedral. <br><br>I welcome this attention, because it means people are noticing that we are doing something special at Manchester Bidwell, acknowledging that our success here has something to say not only to the disadvantaged people we serve at the school but to people everywhere, from all walks of life. Still, on a personal level, as a guy who never forgot where he came from, and who knows firsthand how the realities of race and circumstance, poverty and lowered expectations, can crush human dreams, it amazes me more than a little. I was certainly amazed when Jim Heskett at Harvard got interested in our work. He was intrigued with the news of our success and with the unconventional methods we use, and thought his students might learn something from the way I operate. So he decided to make Manchester Bidwell the subject of a Harvard case study, an extensive, intensive business analysis of what we do and how we do it. Over the next few months, his students studied every aspect of our organization with the same hard-boiled scrutiny they&#x2019;d bring to bear if we were a software giant or cell phone manufacturer instead of an organization dedicated to From the Ghetto to Harvard Business School shaping and guiding the human spirit. Then Jim invited me to his class to answer his students&#x2019; questions and offer whatever wisdom I&#x2019;d gathered from my long years in the trenches. Or something like that. To be honest, as I stood there in the lecture pit that winter morning I wasn&#x2019;t really sure what Jim wanted from me. But one thing was certain:<br>He wasn&#x2019;t expecting me to spout a lot of conventional business wisdom; he knew enough about my story to understand that I don&#x2019;t have much of that. I&#x2019;m no textbook CEO. I don&#x2019;t have an M.B.A. Never took a business course in my life. The truth is, I never set out to be a corporate executive or to run any kind of operation at all. When I started out, all I wanted was to give some kids a chance to work with clay.<br><br>I was nineteen years old in 1968 when I founded the Manchester Craftsmen&#x2019;s Guild, the tiny neighborhood arts center that grew into Manchester Bidwell. Our first home was a derelict row house on Buena Vista Street in Manchester. My plan was to use the space as a studio where I could teach neighborhood kids to make bowls and pots. I was a neophyte potter myself at the time, and making pottery was one of the great joys of my life. I liked the way the wet clay felt in my hands. Working with clay calmed me and excited me all at the same time. There was a sense of control, but also one of rich possibility. And there was a potent sense of accomplishment and pride once you developed some skill at it. A high school art teacher had turned me on to the craft and has been my hero ever since. I was just another aimless kid, coasting through school, bored and disengaged, with no sense of what I&#x2019;d do with my life after graduation, when Frank Ross invited me into his classroom and let me sit at his potter&#x2019;s wheel. The magic I felt when I first laid my hands on wet clay gave me the belief that I could do something interesting with my life. It opened up doors to meaning and possibility that showed me, for the first time, that I had talents and capabilities no one had seen before and that I had never dreamed of. I&#x2019;m convinced that those insights not only gave me a vision of my future, they literally saved my life.<br><br>In 1968, Manchester was suffering from the racial strife that rocked so many inner-city neighborhoods in the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Homes were in flames, riot cops and armed National Guard troops patrolled the streets, there were shootings and frequent clashes between demonstrators and police, and in the middle of it all were a lot of terrified kids, wondering if someone was going to shoot them or set their house on fire.<br><br>I wanted to do something for those kids, but I had no experience as a social worker, teacher, or community activist. I was a know-nothing freshman at the University of Pittsburgh at the time, trying my best to keep from flunking out and to get my own life in order. All I knew was clay and what it had done for me. Intuitively, I knew it could do the same for them. I knew what they needed&#x2013;a safe, sane, quiet environment where they could escape the madness that reigned in the streets, work on some clay, find a way to shape something personal and beautiful, and spend some time in a bright, clean, nurturing place where it did not seem pointless to dream. With the help of local Episcopalian churches, I was able to secure a ramshackle row house, which I cleaned and painted, then furnished with potter&#x2019;s wheels and stocked with clay.<br><br>Then I christened the place the Manchester Craftsmen&#x2019;s Guild and opened the doors.Curious kids trickled in off the sidewalks to see what I was up to. I taught them how to use the wheels, how to center and shape the clay. I don&#x2019;t know what I thought would happen. On some level, I knew I needed such a place as much as the kids did&#x2013;a place where I could keep believing in the power of my own creative possibilities despite the darkness closing in all around me&#x2013;and I hoped the place would shield them from all the poison that was in the streets. At first it was enough just to see them being kids again, giggling each time one of their wobbly pots collapsed into a slippery lump. But some of them kept coming back. I worked with them until they could get the clay to rise and hold form, then work it carefully into a shape that would please the eye. It was an amazing thing to see the looks on their faces as they worked&#x2013;the concentration, the sense of purpose and power, and the sudden glint of excitement as they watched the clay morph into the very pot they had pictured in their minds. I knew what that felt like&#x2013;like you had the whole world in your hands. That was the magic I wanted them to feel. And I knew that, for those moments at least, the troubles of Manchester were far away.<br><br>From the start, I loved the work I was doing, the feeling it gave me to help others open their eyes and see the possibilities before them. But I had no long-term vision for the Craftsmen&#x2019;s Guild. I saw it as a stopgap measure, a life raft for those kids. I certainly never thought it would lead to my life&#x2019;s work. My plan was to get my education degree, then teach history to high school students. But life takes some odd twists and turns. I started hearing from teachers in nearby public schools. They noticed that the kids who came to the Craftsmen&#x2019;s Guild were showing up at school more often. They were behaving better in the classroom, too. And their grades were starting to improve. <br><br>That drew people&#x2019;s attention. Word soon got around that something interesting was happening on Buena Vista Street. Neighborhood leaders began to mark me as a guy who was doing some good in the community. Local artists lent us their support. I was introduced to all the right people, and sources of funding appeared before my eyes. I hired a staff and added programs. More kids walked through the door. The place was taking on a life and an energy of its own, growing rapidly in size, in complexity, and in the scope of its missions. I had no choice but to grow with it. And that meant developing my leadership and management skills, often on the fly.</p><h2>Great Grapes: Grow the Best Ever</h2><p>Grapes are among the most desirable and best-known fruits, prized for their beauty, their succulence and varied flavors, their noble metamorphosis into wine, and their more utilitarian roles as sources of fresh juice and tasty jellies.

They&#x2019;ll need to scale the tallest mountain in the suburbs and sneak into a restaurant filled with people.</p><p>Dangerous humans&#x2014;a strange-talking girl, a huge chef, and a penguin-man&#x2014;lurk around every corner.&nbsp;But there&#x2019;s more than danger in the air.&nbsp;Stick Dog has caught the scent of something even more scrumptious than spaghetti. And he&#x2019;ll risk everything to find out what it is.</p></p><p><p>Tom Watson lives in Chicago with his wife, daughter, and son. He also has a dog, as you could probably guess. The dog is a Labrador-Newfoundland mix. Tom says he looks like a Labrador with a bad perm. He wanted to name the dog "Put Your Shirt On" (please don't ask why), but he was outvoted by his family. The dog's name is Shadow. Early in his career Tom worked in politics, including a stint as the chief speechwriter for the governor of Ohio. This experience helped him develop the unique, storytelling narrative style of the Stick Dog books. More important, Tom's time in politics made him realize a very important thing: Kids are way smarter than adults. And it's a lot more fun and rewarding to write stories for them than to write speeches for grown-ups.</p></p><h2>After The Ashes: Surviving The Coming Nuclear War</h2><p>After the Ashes is more than a typical survival hand guide. Because of the realization that atomic warfare is likely inevitable, it seeks to both inform the reader of why this is the case, and beyond merely lists of survival materials, attempts to enumerate reasonable ways in which mankind can, as it must, recover after such an event. Most materials written on this subject do little other than to teach survival methods themselves, and thus miss one important point; while they may help a person survive, they will not help mankind to truly recover from what would be the most trying period in all of humanity&#39;s history. From shortwave suggestions to suggestions regarding cleanup and restoring order, this guide seeks to add to the scope of literature on the subject from a new perspective, so that hopefully, should such a war occur, and should mankind find himself in the post-atomic era, he will be capable of not merely continuing to exist, but building something better so that such a thing will never happen again. A copy of the Bill of Rights is included within the work as well for handy reference, as after any such exchange such a document is invaluable.</p><p></p><h2>ESV Value Compact Bible (TruTone, Olive, Celtic Cross Design)</h2><p><p>The <em>ESV Value Compact Bible</em> retains many of the components and covenient trim size of the <em>ESV </em><em>Compact Bible </em>but<em> </em>without gilded edges and a ribbon marker&#x2014;a great edition at an affordable price.</p></p><p>First published in 2001, The ESV Bible carries forward the trusted legacy of the Bible in English - the legacy established first in the Tyndale New Testament (1526) and the KJV Bible (1611).

He went to West Point rather against his will and graduated in the middle of his class. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Grant was appointed by the governor to command an unruly volunteer regiment, quickly rising to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers. In February 1862, he took Fort Henry and attacked Fort Donelson. When the Confederate commander asked for terms, Grant replied, &#x201c;No terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted.&#x201d; The Confederates surrendered, and President Lincoln promoted Grant to major general of volunteers. At Shiloh in April, Grant fought one of the bloodiest battles in the West and came out less well. Lincoln fended off demands for his removal by saying, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t spare this man&#x2014;he fights.&#x201d; For his next major objective, Grant then maneuvered and fought skillfully to win Vicksburg, the key city on the Mississippi, cutting the Confederacy in two.

A prot�g� of James Naismith, the game's inventor, McLendon taught his team to play the full-court press and run a fast break that no one could catch. His Eagles would become the highest-scoring college team in America--a basketball juggernaut that shattered its opponents by as many as sixty points per game. Yet his players faced danger whenever they traveled backcountry roads.<br><br>Across town, at Duke University, the best basketball squad on campus wasn't the Blue Devils, but an all-white military team from the Duke medical school. Composed of former college stars from across the country, the team dismantled everyone they faced, including the Duke varsity. They were prepared to take on anyone--until an audacious invitation arrived, one that was years ahead of anything the South had ever seen before. What happened next wasn't on anyone's schedule. <br><br>Based on years of research, <i>The Secret Game </i>is a story of courage and determination, and of an incredible, long-buried moment in the nation's sporting past. The riveting, true account of a remarkable season, it is the story of how a group of forgotten college basketball players, aided by a pair of refugees from Nazi Germany and a group of daring student activists, not only blazed a trail for a new kind of America, but helped create one of the most meaningful moments in basketball history.</p><p>Scott Ellsworth has written about American history for the <i>New York Times, </i>the <i>Washington Post, </i>and the <i>Los Angeles Times. </i>Formerly a historian at the Smithsonian Institution, he is the author of <i>Death in a Promised Land, </i>a groundbreaking account of the 1921 Tulsa race riot. He lives with his wife and twin sons in Ann Arbor, where he teaches at the University of Michigan."As a member of the Duke community, I have long been aware and proud of the secret game. Now Scott Ellsworth has brought it to light. The true story behind this extraordinary, long-buried game goes beyond any one school or any one state. <i>The Secret Game </i>is a triumphant look at how basketball has broken down barriers, and helped create a new kind of America. Every citizen needs to know this story--and to know it now."&#x2015;<b><i>Mike Krzyzewski, head coach of Duke Men's Basketball</i></b><br><br>"There is a basketball on the cover, but this is much more than a story about basketball. Yes, there was a ground-breaking basketball game played in Durham, N.C., seven decades ago, and it is recounted in great detail by Scott Ellsworth. But what we really have here is indispensable social history. White people need to read this book. People of color need to read this book. Whoever you are, you need to read this book."&#x2015;<b><i>Bob Ryan, <i>Boston Globe</i>, <i>ESPN</i>, author of <i>Scribe: My Life in Sports</i></i></b><br><br>"A powerful book that is a page-turner from start to finish....

Through a mixture of oral history and archival research, Ellsworth captures the rich human details of a whole generation of largely forgotten basketball players."&#x2015;<b><i>Nick Romeo, <i>Boston Globe</i></i></b><br><br>"It would be difficult, if not impossible, for me to overstate my admiration for Scott Ellsworth's magnificent <i>The Secret Game</i>. It's a book about race, a book about the South, a book about America, a book about the '40s, a book about change as well as how things remain the same. This is one of the smartest and most eloquent books I've come across in a long time. A masterpiece."&#x2015;<b><i>Steve Yarbrough, author of <i>The Realm of Last Chances</i></i></b><br><br>"A historian with the soul of a poet, Ellsworth offers a remarkably nuanced, vibrant, and eloquent account of life in the South during WWII, and his portraits of the principal players in this secret drama are multitextured and complex."&#x2015;<b><i>Wes Lukowsky, <i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</i></b><br><br>"Ellsworth has unearthed a brave moment in basketball, forgotten to history, which resonates far beyond the court."&#x2015;<b><i>Billy Heller, <i>New York Post</i></i></b><br><br>"Scott Ellsworth has unearthed the facts of this little-known but hugely important moment. His research is as overwhelming as his story-telling style is accessible and engaging. If you love basketball, truly love the game and all that it means in terms of this country and its civil rights history, you'll want to read and reread <i>The Secret Game</i>."&#x2015;<b><i>Roland Lazenby, author of <i>Michael Jordan: The Life</i></i></b><br><br>"Ellsworth skillfully puts this story in the context of World War II, which forced this country to face -- albeit slowly -- its unjust treatment of those who also spilled blood to protect American democracy.

Lauren O. Thyme, Storyteller, with the guidance of Lemurian Elders and the help of Sareya Orion, Library, has created a striking account of the customs, lifestyles, and harmonious community of people known as Lemurians. Lauren has done a masterful job of showing what life was like during this ancient civilization. If you feel drawn to Lemuria, or Mu, for whatever reason, and would like to know more, The Lemurian Way provides you with a truly wonderful understanding and awareness of the Lemurian civilization, and the glory that Lemuria was. And by exploring, studying, and remembering our distant past, we can better understand why we are here now.&#x201d; --- Andrew Lutts, Founder, Salem New Age Center &#x201c;The Lemurian Way could be used as a guidebook for the new millennium.&#x201d; -- Alex Lumen, former art director, FATE magazine &#x201c;Thanks for the awakening your book gave me.&#x201d; &#x2013; Roy Briggs, Nigeria You are loved so dearly in Turkey, Lauren. The Lemurian Way marked a pivotal moment in my awakening. Thank you for your being and sharing. The Lemurian Way is my bedside book, dear author. --- Selin Mikaela Bolu, Turkey Lauren O. Thyme and Sareya Orion have their own soul memories of Lemuria and created this book in partnership with Lemurian Elders. The Lemurian Elders, many of whom may be Ascended Masters, are a loving and gentle group of souls who advise and teach human beings the essential nature of the universe from their perspective in the spirit world. The Elders describe the harmonious life they experienced in Lemuria as a guidepost for human civilization today. They elaborate on the ease of Universal Laws and Wisdom as they lived it, knowledge as old as humanity. Pieces of knowledge have been explored extensively throughout time in myths, legends, archetypes, philosophy, world religions, and mystic thought. Information has issued forth from countless shamans, prophets, mystics, philosophers, poets, psychics, and recently by transpersonal psychologists, scientists, and physicists. However, the Elders&#x2019; intention is to complete our education: to present the entire body of knowledge, kept secret for ages, to prepare for the leap in planetary evolution. To accomplish that, they stimulate deep soul memories by presenting details of their society that encompass the order, logic, and harmony of the universe. They remind us to allow recognition, knowledge residing in individual souls, to just happen. They encourage us, not just to understand with our intellects, but to feel the wisdom in our bodies. Most iimportantly, the Elders quietly remind us that Universal Laws and Wisdom were initiated and put into motion by a loving Creator Source, so that everyone can live one&#x2019;s essential nature of peace, harmony, love, and joy.</p><p>Lauren O.

He proudly followed the Marine credo: 'Improvise, Adapt, Overcome'. He writes: "Sure in winter you can put sodas out on the window sill, but inmate recipes for baking 3-layer cakes and fresh pizzas in an oven-less prison dorm?"

Well, just as it draws iron from the sand, a magnet can manipulate the iron in your bloodstream, improving both circulation and body&nbsp;function. <i>Magnet Therapy </i>is filled with practical information as well as success stories that will bolster your determination to work toward greater health.</p> <p>You would be amazed to learn just how many conditions can be healed with magnet therapy. Diabetes, heart disease, and multiple sclerosis are only three of the thirty-five health issues discussed in this book. Conventional medicine does its best with pills, but treats only the symptoms, while magnet therapy treats the whole body, making it stronger and healthier. Whether this is your first or fortieth time using magnets, <i>Magnet Therapy </i>will teach you to maximize your health in a way that is both scientifically proven and easy to understand.</p></p><p><i> </i><p><i>William H. Philpott, MD, </i>has had specialized training and experience in the fields of psychiatry, neurology, nutrition, electroencephalography, and toxicology. His research into the causes of mental illness and degenerative disease resulted in the publication of <i>Brain Allergies </i>and <i>Victory Over Diabetes</i>. </p><p>HEALTH PROBLEMS are not something you have to live with&#x2015;alternative medicine has practical solutions for identifying and treating the underlying causes and can bring lasting relief for a myriad of diseases. Many people have learned this the hard way, living with discomfort and pain for years before discovering that there is another option. Alternative medicine recognizes that illnesses do not have one cause, but multiple factors that together overload your body systems. Looking at illness and health in this way makes for more effective treatment than the single-cause focus of conventional medicine.</p> <p>In this book, you will learn that once you identify the hidden factors that are combining to produce your illness you can treat each one using magnet therapy and permanently eliminate your symptoms. Patient success stories throughout the book provide practical details on how others were able to reverse their health problems using magnet therapy. Conventional medicine generally offers drug treatments that may temporarily relieve your symptoms, but also introduce serious side effects. Alternative medicine physicians, on the other hand, focus on finding the root causes, rather than merely trying to alleviate symptoms. In this book, we show you how to treat a number of illnesses using safe, noninvasive magnet therapy. Two primary conditions in the body set the groundwork for illness&#x2015;high acidity and a lack of oxygen. Magnet therapy, by normalizing these factors and producing a number of other health-promoting effects, prevents and reverses ill health. Alternative medicine looks at the whole person, considering the individual&#x2019;s symptoms, health history, diet, and underlying imbalances. Healing these underlying causes leading to illness brings lasting relief, not a simple masking of symptoms. This is the basic principle of alternative medicine and the reason why it succeeds where conventional medicine often fails in treatment of chronic disease.</p> <p>This book is here to tell you that you don&#x2019;t have to live with illness, or with a continuing cycle of drugs and their side effects. By treating what is actually causing the condition, not only can health problems be reversed using magnet therapy, but your overall health will be improved. Start with the therapies in this book to relieve your symptoms and eliminate your illness for good.

Which begs the inevitable questions: Is the plot a rehash of the first book? Sure it is, with the action unfolding on yet another secluded island, the mysterious "Site B." Is the cast of characters basically the same? Absolutely, from a freshly minted pair of cute, compu-savvy kids right down to the neatly exhumed chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (who was presumed dead at the close of <i>JP</i>). But is it fun to read? You betcha. Hollywood (and Michael Crichton) keeps telling us the same old stories for a very good reason: we like them.

Fong is currently a sophomore at Stanford University.<b>What is Kawaii?</b><br> Before we get started baking, let&#x2019;s talk about what <i>kawaii</i> means! <i>Kawaii</i> is a Japanese word that best translates to &#x201c;cute,&#x201d; and it describes anything lovable, cuddly, and endearing. The particular style of it is like Hello Kitty, Pok�mon, and Totoro. It often manifests in cute animals (both real and illustrated) with big eyes and heads that are disproportionately large in relation to their bodies. These features emphasize an innocence and youthfulness that is a major component of kawaii style. And beyond cute cuddly creatures, kawaii also frequently means adding a face to something that normally wouldn&#x2019;t have one. For example, see the smiling Sushi Cake Pops on page 197, or the Kawaii Royal Icing Cookies on page 106. These lovable expressions add personality to the otherwise inanimate objects, making them extra cute or &#x201c;kawaii.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Kawaii culture is believed to have originated in the 1970s when teenagers in Japan developed a fun, childlike style of handwriting that was often accompanied by doodles of hearts, stars, and cartoon faces. Many believed this trend emerged in response to the rigidity of post-World War II Japan, as it allowed the Japanese youth to express their individuality. The Japanese stationary brand Sanrio noticed this movement and subsequently launched their cultural icon, Hello Kitty. A huge success among the Japanese population, Hello Kitty took the world by storm, ushering in a worldwide appreciation of kawaii. These days, kawaii style is used for all kinds of clothing, accessories, plush, stationary, and more! It&#x2019;s truly become a cultural phenomenon, globally, and one that I adore because of how fun, colorful, and inviting it is.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Panda Cake</b><br>Pandas are the quintessential kawaii animal. With their big eyes and fluffy bodies, you just want to reach out and give them a big hug. But because a trip to China to see real life pandas isn&#x2019;t in the books for now, I decided to create the next best thing: a cake decorated like a panda! For this one, I used my favorite chocolate cake recipe. In fact, it&#x2019;s become tradition in our family that every April 24&#x2014;my birthday&#x2014;I make and devour an entire chocolate cake by myself. Okay, let me clarify&#x2014;not in<i> one </i>sitting,<i> </i>and my dad will usually have a few slices, but for the most part I take down the whole thing. And my cake of choice is the one used in this recipe. It&#x2019;s rich, fluffy, moist, and absolutely divine when paired with a creamy buttercream frosting. <br> &nbsp;<br>Makes one 6-inch layer cake&nbsp;<br><br> <b>For the Cake:</b><br> Cooking spray<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br>1 1/2 cups sugar<br>2/3 cups unsweetened cocoa powder<br>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda<br>3/4 teaspoon baking powder<br>1 teaspoon table salt<br>2 large eggs, at room temperature<br>3/4 cup buttermilk<br>6 tablespoons canola oil<br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>3/4 cup hot coffee<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>For the Frosting:</b><br> 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br>4 1/2 cups confectioners&#x2019; sugar<br>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>3 tablespoons milk<br>Black and pink gel food colors<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>For the Decorations: </b><br>Rainbow sprinkle mix<br>4 chocolate sandwich cookies, such as Oreos<br>2 pink jelly beans<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>1. Make the cake:</b> Preheat the oven to 350�F. Spray three 6-inch round cake pans with cooking spray. Line the pans with parchment paper and lightly spray again. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>2.</b> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the eggs, buttermilk, oil, and vanilla. Using a handheld electric mixer, beat on medium speed until combined. Pour in the hot coffee and beat on medium speed until just combined. Divide the batter among the prepared pans.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>3.</b> Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers of the cakes comes out clean, 27 to 30 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then run a knife around the edges of the pans and turn the cakes out onto a cooling rack. Peel off the parchment paper and let cool completely.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>4. Make the frosting:</b> In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the confectioners&#x2019; sugar. Beat in the vanilla and milk until combined. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat the frosting on medium-high speed until smooth and fluffy, about 3 minutes. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>5.</b> Transfer 1 tablespoon of the frosting to a small plastic zip-top bag and cut off a small tip. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>6.</b> Transfer 1 tablespoon of the frosting to a separate bowl and color it black with the black gel food color. Transfer it to a small plastic zip-top bag and cut off a small tip. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>7.</b> Transfer 1/2 cup of the frosting to a separate bowl and color it pink with the pink gel food color. Transfer it to a small plastic zip-top bag and cut off a small tip. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>8.</b> Transfer the remaining frosting to a piping bag or large plastic zip-top bag and cut off a large tip.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>9.</b> <b>Decorate the cake:</b> Using a cake leveler or serrated knife, cut the rounded tops off the cakes. Pipe about 1 tablespoon of the remaining white frosting onto a 6-inch cake board, and then place one cake layer on top. Pipe a layer of white frosting onto the cake and spread it evenly with an offset spatula. Place a cake layer on top, pipe on a layer of white frosting, and spread it evenly with an offset spatula. Top with the final cake layer, cut side down. For the crumb coat, pipe a thin layer of white frosting over the entire cake and spread it evenly with an offset spatula. Refrigerate the cake for 15 minutes. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>10.</b> Pipe white frosting over the entire cake and spread it evenly with an offset spatula. Run an icing smoother around the sides of the cake to smooth the frosting. Using an offset spatula, bring the frosting from the top edges of the cake toward the center to create a flat top.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>11.</b> Using the reserved pink frosting, pipe the outline of a scallop border around the top of the cake. Then fill in the scallops with more pink frosting, and pipe pink frosting to cover the top of the cake as well. Refrigerate the cake until the frosting is firm and doesn&#x2019;t stick to your finger when tapped, about 20 minutes. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>12.</b> Using an offset spatula, carefully smooth the scallops and the top of the cake. Press the rainbow sprinkles over the pink frosting.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>13.</b> For the ears, use a serrated knife to cut off about 1/8 inch from the bottom of 2 of the chocolate sandwich cookies to create a flat edge. Place the ears on top of the cake toward the front. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>14.</b> Separate the two remaining chocolate sandwich cookies and scrape off the cream filling. Use a serrated knife to cut two of the chocolate cookies into ovals for eyes, and cut a third chocolate cookie into a triangle for a nose. (You can eat the remaining cookie!) Using the reserved white frosting, pipe dots onto the eyes for pupils.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>15.</b> Press the eyes and nose onto the front of the cake; use the reserved black frosting to pipe on a smile. Press one pink jelly bean on each side of the eyes for cheeks.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Note:</b> Refrigerating the cake before smoothing the scallops allows you to touch them up without distorting their shape. Don&#x2019;t skip this step!</p><h2>Evangelical, Sacramental, and Pentecostal: Why the Church Should Be All Three</h2><p>Evangelical. Sacramental. Pentecostal. Christian communities tend to identify with one of these labels over the other two. Evangelical churches emphasize the importance of Scripture and preaching. Sacramental churches emphasize the importance of the eucharistic table. And pentecostal churches emphasize the immediate presence and power of the Holy Spirit. But must we choose between them? Could the church be all three? Drawing on his reading of the New Testament, the witness of Christian history, and years of experience in Christian ministry and leadership, Gordon T. Smith argues that the church not only <em>can</em> be all three, but in fact <em>must</em> be all three in order to truly be the church. As the church navigates the unique global challenges of pluralism, secularism, and fundamentalism, the need for an integrated vision of the community as evangelical, sacramental, and pentecostal becomes ever more pressing. If Jesus and the apostles saw no tension between these characteristics, why should we?</p><p>Gordon T. Smith is the president of Ambrose University and Seminary in Calgary, Alberta, where he also serves as professor of systematic and spiritual theology. He is an ordained minister with the Christian and Missionary Alliance. He is the author of many books, including <em>Courage and Calling</em> and <em>Called to Be Saints</em>."This book should awaken us from our churchly slumbers. The evangelical, sacramental, and pentecostal streams of Christianity celebrate different things, but we should not think of them, argues Gordon Smith, as competing alternatives. Rather, each of these traditions highlights something essential to full-orbed and flourishing Christian experience. We can no longer afford to pick one favorite while neglecting what the others have to offer. This is a provocative call for a fresh ecumenical synergy&#x2015;for weaving all these elements together into something stronger and better than the older, isolating silos were able by themselves to deliver. Ever the pastor-theologian, Smith concludes with some practical proposals for moving us in this right direction." (Glen G. Scorgie, professor of theology and ethics, Bethel Seminary San Diego)<br><br>"In <em>Evangelical, Sacramental, and Pentecostal</em>, Gordon Smith is a constructive provocateur. The word <em>and</em> in the title of the book is far from a mere grammatical connector. 'And' is indicative of Smith's call to Christians, including evangelical Christians, to embrace together realities which too often are considered incompatible with each other, if not denied altogether. Furthermore, this call is not a call primarily to individual Christians or to some form of private piety. It is a call to churches&#x2015;a call to churches to be the church. At the same time, this book is not primarily a critique but an invitation&#x2015;an invitation to enter into and celebrate, in Smith's words, 'an ecology of grace.' <em>Evangelical, Sacramental, and Pentecostal</em> is a wise and thoughtful invitation, accompanied by concrete suggestions, for churches to enter more fully into the grace that is found in union with Christ." (W. David Buschart, professor of theology and historical studies, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Christians often live in a state of spiritual malnourishment, choosing exclusively between the Word, sacraments, or renewal by the Spirit. In this timely pastoral appeal to overcome historical and theological divisions, Gordon T. Smith invites believers to be drawn into the fullness of life&#x2015;fellowship with the living God&#x2015;by embracing the divinely appointed means of grace." (Jeffrey W. Barbeau, professor of theology, Wheaton College)<br><br>"This is a timely and significant book because it captures the emerging ecumenical, experiential spirit of our times. Smith's book offers a brilliant and practical vision for how the contours of an evangelical, sacramental, and pentecostal spirituality can be integrated into a full-orbed Christian spirituality and ecclesiology. This kind of perspective is absolutely in tune with what the church in post-Christendom needs in these days when we are redefining our identity as God's people and need resources to help guide us in that important work." (Lee Beach, associate professor of Christian ministry, McMaster Divinity College, author of The Church in Exile)<br><br>"This book is a wonderful corrective to the tendency to be locked into our own theological tradition and be critical of other perspectives. Our Christian communities would be more vibrant and attractive to the unbelieving world if we intentionally incorporated the best in all traditions. Dr. Smith's book demonstrates how this can be done with integrity." (Glen Shellrude, professor of New Testament, Alliance Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Gordon T. Smith, president of Ambrose University in Canada, has an exciting and promising proposal in his new book <em>Evangelical, Sacramental, and Pentecostal: Why the Church Should Be All Three</em>. Smith has fashioned a beautiful vision for the unity and interdependence of these major streams of the church. . . . What Smith offers is no airy-fairy ecumenical project. His point is not simply that we can learn from different traditions, but rather that we <em>need</em> each other to survive and thrive in the modern world." (Michael Bird, Christianity Today, April 2017)<br><br>"Excited by Smith&#x2019;s call for a more robust church life, I believe this book can be a tool for the church to become more of what it is called to be&#x2015;both through more balanced fellowship practices and through healthier ecumenical cooperation and relationship. It provides a solid starting point for churches." (Mbherald.com, July 31, 2017)<br><br>"Smith&#x2019;s book will act as a good introduction for Bible-believing Christians to embrace the sacramental and pentecostal approaches."

The Arnold Estate, located just beyond the village of Harrisville, Rhode Island seemed the idyllic setting in which to raise a family. The couple unwittingly moved their five young daughters into the ancient and mysterious farmhouse. Secrets were kept and then revealed within a space shared by mortal and immortal alike. Time suddenly became irrelevant; fractured by spirits making their presence known then dispersing into the ether. The house is a portal to the past and a passage to the future. This is a sacred story of spiritual enlightenment, told some thirty years hence. The family is now somewhat less reticent to divulge a closely-guarded experience. Their odyssey is chronicled by the eldest sibling and is an unabridged account of a supernatural excursion. Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated this haunting in a futile attempt to intervene on their behalf. They consider the Perron family saga to be one of the most compelling and significant of a famously ghost-storied career as paranormal researchers. During a s�ance gone horribly wrong, they unleashed an unholy hostess; the spirit called Bathsheba...a God-forsaken soul. Perceiving herself to be mistress of the house, she did not appreciate the competition. Carolyn had long been under siege; overt threats issued in the form of fire...a mother's greatest fear. It transformed the woman in unimaginable ways. After nearly a decade the family left a once beloved home behind though it will never leave them, as each remains haunted by a memory. This tale is an inspiring testament to the resilience of the human spirit on a pathway of discovery: an eternal journey for the living and the dead.</p></p><p>Andrea Perron was born in Rhode Island in 1958. She is a graduate of Chatham College in Pittsburgh, Pa. having earned an inter-disciplinary degree in philosophy and English literature. This memoir waited thirty years to be told, allowing the time and distance necessary for her family to reveal these long held secrets. The author is currently preparing for release of the second volume in this remarkable trilogy. John Shaw created the cover portrait of their farmhouse as a parting gift. Two months after the Perron family abandoned this place in the country, John, all of nineteen years old, drove from Rhode Island to Georgia. He presented his friends with the watercolor; painted from memory, in memory of a special house which touched his life as well. It remains a treasured keepsake. They loved him then as they love him now</p><h2>The Fine Art of Faking It: A Small Town Love Story (Blue Moon)</h2><p>Davis Gates. Naked.

It will help you to understand your rum - how it's produced (whether from molasses, cane syrup or cane juice) and whether it's dry, sweet, fresh or oaky. More than 100 different rums are featured and analysed, from rich, sweet mellow Guyana rums to the vegetal peppery rums of Martinique or Guadeloupe and contemporary spiced rums. Dave Broom provides a description and graded tasting notes for each brand, allowing you to create the perfect mix every time.

They often use fear tactics and a &#x201c;hide it until marriage&#x201d; mentality. The Church at one time actually called sex a necessary evil for procreation. This couldn&#x2019;t be farther from the truth or God&#x2019;s heart. In his book, <i>Moral Revolution</i>, Kris Vallotton talks about passion and how sex is a gift worth giving. He reminds us what it means to give true love, and about looking forward to sexual intimacy.</p><p>In a frank style, Kris takes on the subject of sex. He stresses that the dilemma of having a sex drive before we should have sex offers people the opportunity to later give something they had to fight for. Something of value. Something of worth. He writes in a way that pulls out the romance in all of us, while at the same time calling us to harness this powerful passion in a way that can actually start a new revolution. It&#x2019;s a revolution that can set people free from exploitation and the myth of &#x201c;anything goes,&#x201d; while freeing us from the path of hurt and pain.</p><p>Kris offers perspective on how to be set free from a legalistic view that portrays our loving God as an oppressive killjoy, and from the mentality of the uptight religious Pharisee. He offers hope for those who want to save a gift for their lifetime lover on their wedding night. This book also brings hope to the broken who are suffering from guilt and shame. We&#x2019;re talking real freedom! When Christ sets you free you are free indeed.</p><p>As a father of five, and from a heart that wants the best for them in every area of their lives, including sexuality, I not only highly recommend this book, but will give a copy to all of my kids.<br> <b>BOB LENZ</b><br> International Speaker, Author, <i>Grace&#x2014;For Those Who Think They Don&#x2019;t Measure Up</i><br> &nbsp;</p><br><br><p>As a senior pastor of a church in Hollywood, California, this book couldn&#x2019;t have come at a better time!

It is so real and organic, shedding the old wineskin of legalism that so many of these efforts get caught up into. Instead, it gives you straight talk and understanding. It&#x2019;s not just a book of insightful teaching, but imparts faith from beginning to end (especially the last chapter), which is so rare for a book on this subject.<br> <b>SHAWN BOLZ</b><br> Senior Pastor, Expression58, Author, <i>Keys to Heaven&#x2019;s Economy</i> and <i>The Throne Room Company<br> </i></p><br><br><p><i>Moral Revolution</i> is an important book for youth, parents and spiritual leaders, and could well become a standard-setter for generations to come.

Walter is also homeless. The medical expenses that came with his mother&#39;s brief and unsuccessful battle against cancer have left him destitute. Still, ever the optimist, Walter believes that if he lives in his car for a few months, he will have the time he needs to find a good job in the business world and turn his life around. His situation gets more complicated when he finds himself attracted to a girl he meets at the mailing center where he keeps a post box.

Walter&#39;s struggles grow when his car is impounded and he can&#39;t afford to pay the fine.

What more could you possibly need?&#x201d; George shot back.<br> <br>Bess rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Not like that. I mean a thing that defines who I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get it. We all know who you are. You&#x2019;re Bess,&#x201d; George said with a shrug, turning her attention back to a game on her phone.<br> <br>George and Bess are cousins and my two best friends. Even though they seem like total opposites&#x2014;George doesn&#x2019;t care about looks or clothes, while Bess is a bit of a fashionista; George loves technology and always has the latest gadget, while Bess prefers snail mail to e-mail&#x2014;they&#x2019;re as close as sisters. Sometimes, though, George can get so caught up in her Twitter feed that she doesn&#x2019;t notice the people sitting right in front of her.<br> <br>In general, I&#x2019;m somewhere in between: I like to look nice and put together, but I don&#x2019;t keep with the latest trends; and I like my smartphone, but I&#x2019;m not obsessed with it. Sometimes I have to be a bridge between them. I could tell this was one of those times.<br> <br>Bess had been acting weird all day. We&#x2019;d gone into town to do some errands&#x2014;mostly just to get out of the house&#x2014;and she had barely said a word. At first I thought it was the weather&#x2014;a cold snap had moved in overnight with the threat of snow later&#x2014;but even after we&#x2019;d stopped at the Coffee Corner, our favorite caf� in River Heights and George&#x2019;s place of employment, to get warm, she still hadn&#x2019;t cheered up.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on, Bess?&#x201d; I asked as gently as I could. Ironically, Bess is the most emotionally intuitive of the three of us. Whenever George or I are upset, Bess knows exactly what to do or say to make us feel better. I wished Bess could talk to Bess, but I&#x2019;d try my best instead.<br> <br>&#x201c;Remember New Year&#x2019;s Eve?&#x201d; Bess asked.<br> <br>I nodded. Bess&#x2019;s parents throw a big party every New Year&#x2019;s Eve. Each year they pick a different theme. One year it was An Evening in Wonderland, and they hung at least a hundred different clocks on the walls, replaced the furniture in one room with doll furniture, spread stuffed bunnies throughout the house, and made place mats out of playing cards. They even hung half a mannequin dressed in a light-blue dress with a white apron from the hallway ceiling, so it looked like Alice was falling through the rabbit hole into the house. It was always the party of the year, and half of River Heights attended.<br> <br>George, Bess, and I have been going to that party for as long as we can remember. When we were younger, Bess&#x2019;s parents would herd us up to her room and we&#x2019;d be asleep long before midnight. As we got older, we kept the tradition of heading up to Bess&#x2019;s room early, only now we watched the ball drop in Times Square on TV, drank glasses of sparkling cider, and shared our resolutions for the coming year.<br> <br>This year had been no different. The theme of the party had been the 1960s, and George, Bess, and Ned, my boyfriend, had scoured As You Wore, the vintage shop in town, for the perfect outfits. Bess&#x2019;s parents had outdone themselves with the decorations. Entering the house felt like stepping through a time warp. The walls, the furniture, and the rugs were all from the 1960s or earlier. They&#x2019;d even swapped out their TV for an older model. We ate a ton of food, danced, took goofy pictures in the photo booth the Marvins had rented, and headed up to Bess&#x2019;s room to watch the ball drop. It had seemed like Bess was having as good a time as the rest of us, so I couldn&#x2019;t imagine what would have made her upset.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. I remember New Year&#x2019;s,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you remember my resolution?&#x201d; Bess asked. I thought back, but it wasn&#x2019;t coming to mind. Bess noticed my hesitancy. &#x201c;George said she wanted to crack five thousand followers on Twitter. Ned said he wanted to make the dean&#x2019;s list. You said you wanted to beat your personal record for solving a case.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly it all came rushing back. &#x201c;You said you wanted to floss more,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Bess nodded glumly. I could see tears brimming in her eyes, and I felt like a horrible friend because I still didn&#x2019;t know why this was making her so upset.<br> <br>It was especially frustrating because I&#x2019;m an amateur detective. I help people track down stolen goods, or figure out who&#x2019;s behind a blackmail attempt. My dad&#x2019;s a prosecutor, and he says that I solve more cases than some of the detectives he works with, so I should have been able to put the clues together and figure out why Bess was so sad. I understood that flossing wasn&#x2019;t the most exciting resolution in the world, but it didn&#x2019;t seem worth crying over.<br> <br>Fortunately, Bess noticed my confusion. &#x201c;You all have your things. Like George is a computer nerd.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; George piped up. She had finally noticed Bess&#x2019;s mood and had put down her phone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me. A computer geek,&#x201d; Bess corrected.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; George replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a detective. Ned is a brain. But I don&#x2019;t know who I am or what I&#x2019;m good at or even what I want to be when I get older.&#x201d;<br> <br>I thought for a second before answering, because I wanted to get this right. I finally understood what Bess was saying, and there was some truth to it: she wasn&#x2019;t as easily categorized as me, George, or even Ned, but that didn&#x2019;t mean she had no identity.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the most compassionate and empathetic person I&#x2019;ve ever met, Bess,&#x201d; I said finally.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s different,&#x201d; Bess countered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but it&#x2019;s still an amazing ability. Don&#x2019;t dismiss that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; George agreed. &#x201c;People like you; that&#x2019;s a skill! Besides, lots of people our age don&#x2019;t know what they&#x2019;re good at or what they&#x2019;re going to be when they grow up. You have time to figure it out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before we could try to console Bess any further, the caf�&#x2019;s door flew open and a voice boomed out, &#x201c;Nancy Drew and Bess Marvin? I thought I saw you through the window!&#x201d;<br> <br>Bess and I turned. A tall, statuesque girl stood in the doorway, looking at us expectantly.<br> <br>Bess and I exchanged a confused glance. Neither of us had any idea who she was.<br> <br>The girl didn&#x2019;t seem to realize our obliviousness and approached our table with a big grin on her face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to grab some green tea, but then we have so much to catch up on!&#x201d;<br> <br>I sat there with a frozen smile on my face, not sure how to respond. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t wait to find out about you as well,&#x201d; Bess said genuinely. That&#x2019;s what I mean about Bess being a people person. She always knows exactly what to say and never makes anyone feel uncomfortable.<br> <br>The girl smiled broadly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back in a minute,&#x201d; she said, and got in line to buy her tea.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who is that?&#x201d; George asked once she was out of hearing range.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; I answered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Me neither,&#x201d; Bess confirmed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, this is going to be supremely awkward if you don&#x2019;t figure out who she is before she gets back,&#x201d; George said.<br> <br>The girl was just waiting for the barista to pour her hot water. She waved at us with a smile. Bess and I smiled back.<br> <br>Bess turned toward me urgently. &#x201c;You need to solve this case and figure out who she is.&#x201d;<br> <br>By my estimate the girl would be back at our table in less than a minute. There wasn&#x2019;t time to do much investigating.<br> <br>I studied her as discreetly as I could, looking for any important details. Her hair hung loose, just brushing her shoulders, but instead of parting in the middle, it flowed back, as if she wore her hair tied back most of the time. She was carrying a small duffel bag; it looked like a gym bag but had a pink satin ribbon poking out of it. I knew that was important, but I couldn&#x2019;t figure out what it signified. She wore a skirt, and I noticed the muscular definition of her calves through her tights. She was absentmindedly rotating her ankle, turning her foot out at a ninety-degree angle.<br> <br>All of a sudden, a memory flooded back&#x2014;standing behind a girl doing the same move in Miss Taylor&#x2019;s ballet class eight years ago.<br> <br>As the girl approached us, I could feel Bess&#x2019;s nervous eyes on me. I stood up, holding my arms out for a hug. &#x201c;Maggie,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so good to see you again!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;George,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;this is Maggie Richards. She was in Miss Taylor&#x2019;s ballet class with Bess and me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But then she moved to Cleveland to attend a prestigious ballet academy,&#x201d; Bess continued, her face alight in recognition.<br> <br>Maggie nodded, blushing a little.<br> <br>&#x201c;From our very first class,&#x201d; I explained, &#x201c;it was clear Maggie was a star.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; Maggie said bashfully.<br> <br>But it was true. Even at five years old, you could tell that Maggie truly had a gift. Miss Taylor was always complimenting Maggie on her technique, her extension, and her line, but more than that, there was something inherently expressive about the way she moved. When she danced the part of one of the polichinelles (the children who emerge from Mother Ginger&#x2019;s skirt) in The Nutcracker, you could see true joy in her movements. Even just doing barre work, the exercises we did to warm up, you couldn&#x2019;t take your eyes off Maggie. She was magnetic. No one had been surprised when she was accepted into the Cleveland Ballet Academy to train as a professional ballerina.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing back in town?&#x201d; Bess asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in a touring production of Sleeping Beauty, and there&#x2019;s a performance tomorrow in River Heights,&#x201d; Maggie explained.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great!&#x201d; I exclaimed. &#x201c;Does this mean you&#x2019;re a prima ballerina now?&#x201d;<br> <br>Maggie shook her head. &#x201c;Not yet, but this tour is specifically for the most promising dancers in the region. They auditioned dancers from the top dance schools in three states. It&#x2019;s to give us a taste of what touring would feel like if we did turn professional.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fantastic,&#x201d; Bess said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re so happy for you!&#x201d;<br> <br>Maggie looked around the shop for a second, then leaned in close, as if she was going to tell us a secret. &#x201c;Actually, this River Heights performance could be my big break,&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>&#x201c;How so?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Supposedly, Oscar LeVigne will be in attendance.&#x201d;<br> <br>For the second time that day, Bess and I exchanged confused glances. We didn&#x2019;t have any idea who Oscar LeVigne was.<br> <br>Maggie noticed and started laughing. &#x201c;Wow, you guys must have quit ballet ages ago if you&#x2019;ve forgotten Oscar LeVigne. Miss Taylor used to talk about him all the time.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shrugged. &#x201c;Yeah, I stopped in middle school. I just didn&#x2019;t have the time with my cases.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cases?&#x201d; Maggie asked. &#x201c;Like a detective?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded as she tried to process this. People always seem surprised when they find out I&#x2019;m an amateur sleuth.<br> <br>&#x201c;I do remember you always reading mysteries before class,&#x201d; Maggie remembered. &#x201c;What about you, Bess? You were a really talented dancer, if I recall.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bess blushed. &#x201c;I just lost my passion for it. I felt like I wasn&#x2019;t getting any better and I&#x2019;d never be as good as I wanted to be.&#x201d; She paused for a moment. &#x201c;I do miss it sometimes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Maggie continued, &#x201c;Oscar LeVigne is a famous ballet critic. He&#x2019;s known for spotting upcoming stars. A review from him can make or break careers. If I get a good one, there&#x2019;s a really good chance I&#x2019;ll be asked to audition for a professional company. If I get a bad one . . . I don&#x2019;t even want to think about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll do great,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, and we&#x2019;ll be there cheering you on,&#x201d; Bess said. &#x201c;Just like we were at the recital when the ballet academy scout showed up all those years ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maggie gave us a grateful smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so good to see you two. I&#x2019;ve missed you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You too,&#x201d; Bess said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to stay and chat, but I have to get to rehearsal by three o&#x2019;clock and I can&#x2019;t be late. Jamison, our choreographer and my teacher at the academy, is really strict. You have to do an extra grand pli� for every minute you&#x2019;re late; if you&#x2019;re more than twenty minutes late, you sit out the next performance. Maybe we could meet for dinner later?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That sounds great,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; George interrupted. &#x201c;Did you say three o&#x2019;clock?&#x201d;<br> <br>Maggie nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s ten after three right now!&#x201d; George exclaimed, holding out her watch.<br> <br>&#x201c;What!?&#x201d; Maggie practically shrieked. &#x201c;My phone says it&#x2019;s ten after two!&#x201d;</p><h2>Dinosaur Facts and Figures: The Theropods and Other Dinosauriformes</h2><p><p><b>An illustrated record book of theropod facts and figures&#x2015;from the biggest to the fastest to the smartest</b></p><p>The theropod dinosaurs ruled the planet for millions of years, with species ranging from the mighty <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i> to feathered raptors no bigger than turkeys. <i>Dinosaur Facts and Figures</i> is a stunningly illustrated book of records for these marvelous creatures&#x2015;such as the biggest, the smallest, and the fastest theropods, as well as the ones with the most powerful bite.</p><p>This one-of-a-kind compendium features more than 3,000 records, covers some 750 theropod species, and includes a wealth of illustrations ranging from diagrams and technical drawings to full-color reconstructions of specimens.

As a new college graduate, armed only with a philosophy degree and a singular lack of career direction, he became a valet parker for a large luxury hotel in New Orleans. Yet, rising fast through the ranks, he ended up working in &#x201c;hospitality&#x201d; for more than a decade, doing everything from supervising the housekeeping department to manning the front desk at an upscale Manhattan hotel. He&#x2019;s checked you in, checked you out, separated your white panties from the white bed sheets, parked your car, tasted your room-service meals, cleaned your toilet, denied you a late checkout, given you a wake-up call, eaten M&amp;Ms out of your minibar, laughed at your jokes, and taken your money. In <i>Heads in Beds</i> he pulls back the curtain to expose the crazy and compelling reality of a multi-billion-dollar industry we <i>think</i> we know. <br></p><p><i>Heads in Beds</i> is a funny, authentic, and irreverent chronicle of the highs and lows of hotel life, told by a keenly observant insider who&#x2019;s seen it all. Prepare to be amused, shocked, and amazed as he spills the unwritten code of the bellhops, the antics that go on in the valet parking garage, the housekeeping department&#x2019;s dirty little secrets&#x2014;not to mention the shameless activities of the guests, who are rarely on their best behavior. Prepare to be moved, too, by his candor about what it&#x2019;s like to toil in a highly demanding service industry at the luxury level, where people expect to get what they pay for (and often a whole lot more). Employees are poorly paid and frequently abused by coworkers and guests alike, and maintaining a semblance of sanity is a daily challenge.</p><p>Along his journey Tomsky also reveals the secrets of the industry, offering easy ways to get what you need from your hotel without any hassle. This book (and a timely proffered twenty-dollar bill) will help you score late checkouts and upgrades, get free stuff galore, and make that pay-per-view charge magically disappear. Thanks to him you&#x2019;ll know how to get the very best service from any business that makes its money from putting heads in beds. Or, at the very least, you will keep the bellmen from taking your luggage into the camera-free back office and bashing it against the wall repeatedly.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2012:</strong> Always tip. If you can&#x2019;t tip, be nice. And if you can&#x2019;t manage either, you might be better off unwrapping a new toothbrush every day. That&#x2019;s just one lesson to be learned from Jacob Tomsky&#x2019;s gonzo account of his years as a front-desk clerk at hotels in New Orleans and New York. From the glad-handing doormen to the unsung workers in the &#x201c;back of the house,&#x201d; Tomsky exposes the machinery and machinations that make luxury hotels run (if not always smoothly), advising his potential guests about whose palms to grease (and how much) in order to get that coveted park-view upgrade. Informative and mildly salacious, <em>Heads in Beds</em> is an entertaining peek inside the places people go to get away, and the stunts they pull when they get there. --<em>Jon Foro<br></em> <p><b>Amazon Exclusive: An Essay by Jacob Tomsky</b></p> <p>When I started working in hotels the computer screens glowed in one color, alien green, and the monitors were the size of boulders. We used to confidently toss comment cards in the trash (or, as we referred to it, file them in the &#x201c;T&#x201d; file) making them disappear forever. I used to cash checks by picking up the phone and speaking to another human being. Music in the lobby was usually provided by a piano player, who would swivel his head at passing guests with a ridiculous, pasty-looking smile as he tapped out non-offensive cover songs played with a non-offensive classical flourish.</p> <p>Now, mid-volume, beat-heavy techno seeps from recessed speakers built into the lobby&#x2019;s crown molding. The screens are flat. You can&#x2019;t manage to direct anything from Trip Advisor into the &#x201c;T&#x201d; file and all the guests want to hook up their iPad to the toilet or whatever. And if you pay with a check I still have to pick up the phone, which is extremely irritating because who pays with checks anymore? Stop it.</p> <p>But all of that change means nothing. Because I&#x2019;ll tell you what hasn&#x2019;t changed: The front desk agents, the bellmen, the doormen, the housekeepers, the room service attendants, and the managers. Hotel employees are still version 1.0 and I guarantee if you brought me to a bar and sat me next to a front desk agent from 1897, we&#x2019;d over-drink and swap the same type of hilarious stories about the same type of insane guests. Hospitality, no matter how slick it gets, will always be a business run by people who serve people. It will always be about service. It will always take a person to explain that, no, you cannot hook up your iPad to the toilet but you <em>can</em> use it to control the lights and wirelessly play music through the in-room speaker system. And guests still, and hopefully will forever, hand me physical comment cards, which I will continue to throw in the trash.</p> <p>During all these renovations (while I said things like, &#x201c;Wait, they made the internet <em>wireless</em>? It&#x2019;s in the goddamn <em>air</em> now?&#x201d;) I was always writing. I grew up reading novel after novel and that&#x2019;s all I wanted from life, to give back and write something good. After years of hotel work and relocations that took me from New Orleans to Paris to Copenhagen and ultimately New York City, I finally conceived the idea for <em>Heads in Beds</em>. I put everything I had into it, all my knowledge of the industry and the writing skills I&#x2019;d developed since I was a child. I truly hope you find it funny and informative and that it helps you navigate the crooked halls of hospitality. That has always been my goal, to write something good.</p> <p>That and hang out with a front desk agent from 1897.</p><p>Jacob Tomsky is a dedicated veteran of the hospitality business.

This celebration of nearly fifty years of groundbreaking performance art demonstrated once again that Marina Abramovi&#x107; is truly a force of nature.<br><br>The child of Communist war-hero parents under Tito&#x2019;s regime in postwar Yugoslavia, she was raised with a relentless work ethic. Even as she was beginning to build an international artistic career, Marina lived at home under her mother&#x2019;s abusive control, strictly obeying a 10 p.m. curfew. But nothing could quell her insatiable curiosity, her desire to connect with people, or her distinctly Balkan sense of humor&#x2014;all of which informs her art and her life. The beating heart of <i>Walk Through Walls</i> is an operatic love story&#x2014;a twelve-year collaboration with fellow performance artist Ulay, much of which was spent penniless in a van traveling across Europe&#x2014;a relationship that began to unravel and came to a dramatic end atop the Great Wall of China.<br><br>Marina&#x2019;s story, by turns moving, epic, and dryly funny, informs an incomparable artistic career that involves pushing her body past the limits of fear, pain, exhaustion, and danger in an uncompromising quest for emotional and spiritual transformation. A remarkable work of performance in its own right, <i>Walk Through Walls</i> is a vivid and powerful rendering of the unparalleled life of an extraordinary artist.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of November 2016:</strong> She&#x2019;s nuts. There will be devotees devouring <em>Walk Through Walls</em> who will revel in the genius of performance artist Marina Abramovi&#x107;. But for those approaching this frank and fascinating memoir not knowing much about her, that would be an understandable assessment. After all, Abramovi&#x107; has willingly had a loaded pistol pointed at her head, been maimed by strangers, she&#x2019;s lost consciousness after laying in the middle of a gas-soaked star set aflame (and that&#x2019;s just for starters). It&#x2019;s an odd career trajectory considering Abramovi&#x107;&#x2019;s antithetical upbringing under the hem of a tyrannical mother who insisted she be home by ten at the tender age of...24. Danica Rosi&#x107; was seemingly ashamed of her daughter&#x2019;s artistic endeavors, and yet when she died, Abramovi&#x107; discovered that she had stashed away newspaper clippings about her performances&#x2014;holey clippings where she had carefully cut out her daughter&#x2019;s often nude (and sometimes mutilated) visage. You might be tempted to excise the more disturbing aspects of Abramovi&#x107;&#x2019;s narrative as well, but like a gruesome car crash, it&#x2019;s tough to look away. And if you find yourself cringing, well then, that&#x2019;s the point. One of the main purposes of Abramovi&#x107;&#x2019;s art--of her life--is to learn how to confront and transcend the uncomfortable&#x2014;the physically and the emotionally painful. You may come away from <em>Walk Through Walls</em> thinking, yeah, this lady, she cray. But there is something to be said for someone with the audacity to run towards what the rest of us are only too happy to flee. <em>--Erin Kodicek, The Amazon Book Review</em>Raised in Yugoslavia, legendary performance artist Marina Abramovic now makes her primary residence in New York and in the Hudson Valley.</p><h2>Making It Easy For Patients to Say &#34;Yes&#34;</h2><p>Making It Easy for Patients to Say &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; reveals how to make case acceptance of complex care dentistry predictably successful.

Will they pass high school? Should they go to college? Will they find love? And what ways do they want to act in the world? The uncertainty surrounding the future can be overwhelming. Sadly, and all too often, if things don&#x2019;t go smoothly, adolescents will begin labeling themselves as losers, unpopular, unattractive, weird, or dumb. And, let&#x2019;s not forget the ubiquitous &#x2018;not good enough&#x2019; story that often begins during these formative years. These labels are often carried forward throughout life. So what can you do, now, to help lighten this lifelong burden?</p><p><i>The Thriving Adolescent </i>offers teachers, counselors, and mental health professionals powerful techniques for working with adolescents. Based in proven- effective acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), the skills and tips outlined in this book will help adolescents and teens manage difficult emotions, connect with their values, achieve mindfulness and vitality, and develop positive relationships with friends and family. The evidence-based practices in this book focus on developing a strong sense of self, and will give adolescents the confidence they need to make that difficult transition into adulthood.</p><p>Whether it&#x2019;s school, family, or friend related, adolescents experience a profound level of stress, and often they lack the psychological tools to deal with stress in productive ways. The skills we impart to them now will help set the stage for a happy, healthy adulthood. If you work with adolescents or teens, this is a must-have addition to your professional library.</p></p><p><b>Louise L.

From the beginning, I felt compelled to reflect upon how, as a therapist, my goal was always to help distressed adolescents adapt to the adult world. This book turns that assumption upside down and asks us instead to help adolescents linger longer in their journey to adulthood by cultivating their abilities to notice what is going on in their world; to detach from destructive, self-focused mental chatter; and to be playful and experimental in their behaviors. Just as it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a prosocial approach like the DNA-V model to give us a sense of direction with a distressed adolescent. This book is packed full of revealing insights, interesting case examples, therapist-client dialogues, practical clinical tips, teaching protocols, and worksheets. All of this is done in an easy-to-read, conversational, and entertaining style. <i>The Thriving Adolescent</i> addresses the social landscape of adolescence, from the intricacies of developing healthy self-narratives to creating naturally occurring prosocial groups that help adolescents discover the practice of kindness to self and others. This book is a must-read for teachers, school counselors, therapists, and anyone else who wants to help teenagers thrive.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Kirk Strosahl, PhD</b>, cofounder of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and coauthor of <i>Inside This Moment</i> and<i> In This Moment</i><br><br>&#x201c;This book breaks new ground in our understanding of how to nurture the development of adolescents. It translates the acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) perspective into a strategy for helping young people develop social and emotional competence. I expect that it will enable schools, families, clinics, juvenile justice works, and communities become much more oriented toward ensuring that young people become caring and productive members of their communities.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Anthony Biglan, PhD</b>, senior scientist at Oregon Research Institute, and author of <i>The Nurture Effect</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is an excellent resource written by two eminent thinkers and skilled practitioners.

Kashdan, PhD</b>, professor of psychology at George Mason University and coauthor of <i>The Upside of Your Dark Side</i><br><br>&#x201c;This book is not about psychopathology. It is about that struggle for identity and becoming that happens in adolescence. Hayes and Ciarrochi offer a comprehensive developmental approach built on the best available science. It contains well-thought-out theory to ground the work and is packed with tools, transcripts, and real-life examples to make it readily accessible to any teacher, counselor, and health care professional.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Kelly G.

This book is an engaging and clear road map with its practical suggestions, worksheets, exercises, and examples.

The book is rich with ideas at the interface between positive psychology and youth development, and with practical strategies for helping young people identify meaningful goals and life values.

The combination of Hayes&#x2019;s and Ciarrochi&#x2019;s expertise in clinical and research work with adolescents contribute to make acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) simple to apply even for those who are new to this third-generation cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approach. Their DNA-V model is robustly grounded in the ACT research tradition. The authors distill its essence into three core behaviors, making it easy to build psychological flexibility and openness to the world and to any experience (which is basically what is needed by any adolescent in the world). There is no need to be an ACT expert to practice the DNA-V model, but you will become that expert. Exercises and metaphors are specifically tailored within a developmental frame and with adolescence in mind to help the reader become the context that models, instigates, and reinforces DNA skills in young people. This book should be read (and practiced) by any person interested in adolescence, or in being a therapist, counselor, teacher, or simply a parent.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Giovambattista Presti</b>, associate professor of psychology and coordinator of the undergraduate program in psychology at Kore University of Enna, Italy<br><br>&#x201c;Listen up counselors, teachers, and primary care clinicians.

He is the illustrator of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling books <i>A Fine, Fine School</i> by Sharon Creech and <i>Diary of a Worm</i> and <i>Diary of a Spider</i>, both written by Doreen Cronin. Mr. Bliss lives with his family in northern Vermont.This read-aloud Halloween picture book offers appealing illustrations by Harry Bliss, fun facts about witches (did you know that most are afraid of humans?), and a fun encounter between a little witch and a little human that tests the courage of both. The youthful Elle Fanning (sister of actress Dakota) does a truly fine job narrating this small story. She doesn't rush, is young enough to sound just right for the part, and has a pleasant voice that's full of quirky expression. Fanning enjoys the story--so listeners will, too. In addition to her contributions, the production's fun sound effects (a spooky-sounding waltz score, the whoosh of a broom in flight) add dimension to the listening experience.

It has also been the spirit behind the Bound4LIFE prayer movement and is presently challenging the death culture and the abortion altar in this nation.I believe that a return to Nazirite consecration is the only hope for a return to God in America. And it will be the ground preparation, even the forerunner, for the greatest spiritual awakening she has ever seen.</p><p></p><h2>Halloween Favorites, Bk 1: 9 Original Piano Solos by Alfred and Myklas Composers</h2><p>Throughout the years, Alfred Music and Myklas Music Press have published solos for the Halloween season that have become favorites of both students and teachers.

In The Soul of a Butterfly the great champion takes readers on a spiritual journey through the seasons of life, from childhood to the present, and shares the beliefs that have served him well.<br> <br>After fighting some of the fiercest bouts in boxing history against Joe Frazier and George Foreman, today Muhammad Ali faces his most powerful foe&#x2014;outside the boxing ring. Like many people, he battles an illness that limits his physical abilities, but as he says, "I have gained more than I have lost....I have never had a more powerful voice than I have now." Ali reflects on his faith in God and the strength it gave him during his greatest challenge, when he lost the prime years of his boxing career because he would not compromise his beliefs. He describes how his study of true Islam has helped him accept the changes in his life and has brought him to a greater awareness of life's true purpose. As a United Nations "Messenger of Peace," he has traveled widely, and he describes his 2002 mission to Afghanistan to heighten public awareness of that country's desperate situation, as well as his more recent meeting with the Dalai Lama.<br> <br>Ali's reflections on topics ranging from moral courage to belief in God to respect for those who differ from us will inspire and enlighten all who read them. Written with the assistance of his daughter Hana, <i>The Soul of a Butterfly</i> is a compassionate and heartfelt book that will provide comfort for our troubled times.</p><p>Muhammad Ali's core principles of confidence, conviction, dedication, giving, respect, and spirituality guided him and made him one of the most beloved symbols of peace and well-being in America and the world.<br> <br>First known for boxing, and later for his conscientious stance on the Vietnam War draft, Ali focused his awareness of the needs of his fellow citizens and those in the developing world to direct his good work. In addition to challenging racial and religious preconceptions at home, he served as a symbol of hope and a catalyst for constructive international dialogue, delivered sorely-needed medical supplies to an embargoed Cuba, provided more than 22 million meals to the world&#x2019;s hungry, and helped secure the release of fifteen U.S. hostages from Iraq during the first Gulf War. The United Nations named him a Messenger of Peace, and he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as well as Amnesty International&#x2019;s Lifetime Achievement Award. In September 2012, he was the recipient of the prestigious National Constitution Center Liberty Medal.<br> <br>Among his many projects, Muhammad cofounded the Muhammad Ali Center with his wife Lonnie, and contributed substantially to the awareness and research efforts regarding Parkinson&#x2019;s disease.<br> <br>Visit the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky, or online at AliCenter.org.<br><br>Hana Ali is former heavyweight boxing champion of the world Muhammad Ali's daughter and lives near her father and stepmother in Berrien Springs, Michigan.<b>The Foundation of Life</b><br><br>I can remember, when I was just a kid in Louisville, Kentucky, my mother would wake my brother and me early every Sunday morning. She would come into our room, kiss us on the forehead, and say in a gentle whisper, "Wake up, tinky baby, wake up, Rudy, we're going to thank the Lord!"<br><br>My mother would sometimes call me "GG," too, because those were the first syllables I had spoken. After I won the Gold Gloves, I told her that from the very beginning I was trying to say "Golden Gloves." I thought my mother had a tiny little bird nose. I don't know why I thought that, because birds don't have noses, but from the moment I said it we all started calling her Mama Bird. After waking me and Rudy, Bird would cook us a nice breakfast. While we ate, she would iron our best clothes and lay them out on the bed. Then she would call us for a bath. After getting dressed, Rudy and I would go outside to sit on the front porch and shoot marbles before we headed off for Sunday school.<br><br>I can remember trying hard not to get dirty. I knew I looked handsome in my freshly ironed shirt and bow tie. When Bird walked out beside my father, Cassius Clay, or Cash, I remember looking up at them with pride, thinking how pretty she looked and how handsome he was with his thick black mustache. Cash would often say to me, "Most men envy me because they can't grow a mustache as long and thick as mine."<br><br>What he said has always stuck with me. I think that to him, his mustache was a source of pride. To this day, every so often, I let my own grow.<br><br>I had a strong foundation growing up; my parents were loving, affectionate people. Ever since I can remember, my father was always hugging and kissing us. He would say "give me those jaws" (his term for kissing our cheeks). Then he kissed us until our cheeks turned red. Cash always made me feel important. Although, at times my father had a quick temper, and my parents had disagreements, I had a happy home life and I knew that I was loved. My parents made me feel special. When it wasn't my father's affection, it was my mother's stories. Mama Bird was always telling me about the time I was born. She said that I was such a pretty baby, everyone thought I was a girl, and that from the moment they brought me home, Cash was "biting my jaws." My parents weren't perfect, but they each had a loving nature. My father was a painter. He made his living painting murals and signs. Almost every Baptist church around Louisville has his work in them. My father was very talented; I have one of his paintings hanging on my office wall, right above my desk. Cash used to tell people that he wasn't just a painter; he was an artist. Sometimes he would take me and Rudy to work with him. Cash would teach us how to mix the paint and lay out a sign. I could draw a little, but nothing special. It was Rudy that took after Cash. He is an artist, too. Cash used to say that if it weren't for the way things were then, a lot more people would have known what he could do. My father raised us well. He made sure we were surrounded by good people, taught us to always confront the things we feared, and to try to be the best at whatever we did. After delivering his advice, Cash would say, "These are the things my father said to me, and you don't learn them by accident, they have to be taught."<br><br>Cash was one of a kind; he was full of life and energy. He loved hugging, kissing, talking, and debating. He was my father and my friend. He was at my side when he could be and we had a lot more good times together than bad.<br><br>Sometimes, after school, when we finished our homework, Rudy and I would play outside with some of the other kids in the neighborhood. I used to ask Rudy to throw rocks at me to see if he could hit me. He thought that I was crazy, but no matter how many he threw, he could never hit me. I was too fast. I was running left, and right, ducking, dodging, and jumping out of the way. My brother and I had a lot of fun together, we never really got into fights. My mother used to tell me that when I was about four, whenever she would try to discipline Rudy, I would step in and say, "Don't you spank my baby." Rudy and I have always been close. He's my younger brother and I love him.<br><br>I wasn't much trouble as a child, but when I did cut up, Mama Bird just sat me in a corner and put an old bear head rug in the middle of the floor. I was so scared of it, I didn't move an inch. I thought the rug might jump up and bite me. My mother was a gentle lady. She always spoke in a tender voice and I never heard her say a bad thing about anyone. She didn't gossip or meddle in other people's business. She taught us that prejudice was wrong, and to always treat people with love and respect. My mother loved to cook, eat, make clothes, and be with her family. I loved her very much; there's never been anyone better to me in my whole life.<br><br>I learned a lot from my parents while I was growing up. I noticed how they remained dignified in the face of injustice. I saw how they responded to the people around them; I witnessed how my mother would forgive, not hate. And how Cash always held his head high and he worked hard. Growing up, we were poor in terms of money, but we were rich to have had so much love and pride in our household. We were raised with strong values and learned the importance of integrity and compassion. More important than the words, I learned by their example.<br><br>My mother was a Baptist and my father was a Methodist, but we always went to my mother's church. She taught us everything she believed was true about God. Cash used to say that he let Mama Bird raise us her way, because she was a good Baptist, and that a woman is better than a man, so we should follow our mother.<br><br>When I was in junior high school I applied for a job cleaning the blackboards and desks and doing odd jobs at Spalding College in Louisville. Sister James Ella gave me the job. I made a few dollars a week, working under the direction of Sister Ann. Sister James Ella was a sweet lady. She showed me how to clean shelves and sweep the floor. She passed away a few years ago, but I will always remember her. I had a good childhood. There were obstacles, and hardships, but I remained on the straight path. I kept my values in mind, and my faith remained strong. Although my religion would change later in my life, God was always in my heart.<br><br>My mother once told me that my confidence in myself made her believe in me. I thought that was funny, because it was her confidence in me that strengthened my belief in myself. I didn't realize it then, but from the very beginning, my parents were helping me build the foundation for my life.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Muhammad Ali Family Trust</p><h2>IP Subnetting - From Zero to Guru</h2><p><p>** This book is an update to Subnetting Secrets which was first written in 2006 *</p><p>IP subnetting is a subject you need to master if you want to enjoy a successful career in IT.

For official purposes, these agents do not exist. They are sent out on missions to spy on terrorists, hack into crucial documents, and gather intel on global threats&#x2014;all without gadgets or weapons. It is an extremely dangerous job, but these agents have one critical advantage: adults never suspect that teens are spying on them. <br><br>In THE DEALER James is on his most daring mission yet: to smack down the world's most powerful drug lord. It means hitting the streets, where the dealers work. It's a vicious business. But James is going to take it down...from the top.</p><p>Robert Muchamore was born in London in 1972 and used to work as a private investigator. CHERUB is his first series and is published in more than twenty countries.

James and Bruce had given up trying to swat them off. The boys had jogged ten kilometers along a twisted gravel path. It was uphill, heading towards a villa where two eight-year-olds were being held hostage.<br> <br>&#x201c;Better give us a minute,&#x201d; James huffed, leaning forward and resting his palms against his knees. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m wiped.&#x201d;<br> <br>If James had wrung out his T-shirt, he could have filled a mug with sweat.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a year younger than you,&#x201d; Bruce said impatiently. &#x201c;You should be the one pushing me. It&#x2019;s that gut you&#x2019;re carrying.&#x201d;<br> <br>James looked down at himself. &#x201c;Give over, I&#x2019;m hardly fat.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not exactly thin either. You&#x2019;re gonna get crucified at your next medical. They&#x2019;ll put you on a diet and make you run all that off.&#x201d;<br> <br>James straightened up and drank some water from his canteen.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my fault, Bruce. It&#x2019;s genetic. You should have seen the size of my mum before she died.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bruce laughed. &#x201c;There were three Toffee Crisp and one Snickers wrapper in our bin last night. That&#x2019;s not genetic, that&#x2019;s being a pig.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t all have little stick-insect bodies like you,&#x201d; James said, bitterly. &#x201c;Are you ready?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We might as well check the map now we&#x2019;ve stopped,&#x201d; Bruce said. &#x201c;See how far it is to the villa.&#x201d;<br> <br>James got a map out of his pack. Bruce had a GPS clipped on his shorts. The tiny unit told you your exact position anywhere on the planet to within a couple of meters. Bruce transposed the coordinates on to the map and used his finger to trace the winding gravel path towards the villa.<br> <br>&#x201c;Time to go off road,&#x201d; Bruce said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s less than half a kilometer away.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really steep,&#x201d; James said, &#x201c;and the ground crumbles around here. It&#x2019;s gonna be a nightmare.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Bruce said, &#x201c;unless your plan is to walk up to the front gate of the villa, ring the doorbell, and say, &#x2018;Excuse me love, can we have our hostages back?&#x2019; I think we&#x2019;d better cut into the bushes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bruce had a point. James gave up trying to fold the map properly and stuffed it in his pack. Bruce led the way into the scrub, the tinder-dry plants crunching under his trainers. It hadn&#x2019;t rained on the island for two months. There&#x2019;d been bush fires in the east. When the sky was clear, you could see the plumes of smoke.<br> <br>James&#x2019;s damp skin soon had a coating of grit. He grabbed on to plants, using them to pull his way up the steep slope. You had to be careful: some plants had barbs, others erupted from the dry ground as soon as you pulled on them, leaving you holding a clump of roots, clutching desperately for something sturdier before you tumbled backwards.<br> <br>When they reached the wire fence around the villa, they backed up a few meters and lay flat on the ground, collecting their thoughts. Bruce was moaning something about his hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you whinging about?&#x201d; James asked.<br> <br>Bruce showed James his palm. Even in the half-light, James could see the blood trickling down Bruce&#x2019;s arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d you do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bruce shrugged. &#x201c;Somewhere coming up the hill. I didn&#x2019;t realize until we stopped.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better clean it up for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>James tipped some water out of his canteen, washing away most of the blood. He got a first aid kit out of his pack; then lit a small torch and clamped it between his teeth, so he could see what he was doing while keeping both hands free. A thorn bulged under the webbing between Bruce&#x2019;s middle fingers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nasty,&#x201d; James said. &#x201c;Does it hurt?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of stupid question is that?&#x201d; Bruce snapped. &#x201c;Of course it does.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Am I supposed to pull it out?&#x201d; James asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Bruce said wearily. &#x201c;Do you ever listen in class? Always remove splinters, unless there is severe and profuse bleeding, or you suspect you&#x2019;ve punctured a vein or artery. Then apply disinfectant and a clean dressing or sticking plaster.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You sound like you swallowed the textbook,&#x201d; James said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was on the same first aid course as you, James. Only I didn&#x2019;t spend the entire three days trying to get off with Susan Kaplan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pity she had a boyfriend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Susan doesn&#x2019;t have a boyfriend,&#x201d; Bruce said. &#x201c;She was just trying to get rid of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; James said, crushed. &#x201c;I thought she liked me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bruce didn&#x2019;t answer. He was biting down on the strap of his backpack. He didn&#x2019;t want anyone in the villa to hear if the pain made him scream out.<br> <br>James lined up his tweezers. &#x201c;Ready?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bruce nodded.<br> <br>The thorn slid out easily enough. Bruce moaned as a fresh dribble of blood trickled down his hand. James mopped it up, rubbed on antiseptic cream, and wound a bandage tightly between Bruce&#x2019;s fingers.<br> <br>&#x201c;All done,&#x201d; James said. &#x201c;Are you all right to carry on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t turn back after going this far.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You rest for a minute,&#x201d; James said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll sneak up to the fence and check out the security.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch out for video cameras,&#x201d; Bruce said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be expecting us.&#x201d;<br> <br>When James switched off the torch, there was only moonlight left. He shuffled to the fence on his belly. The villa looked impressive: two storys, four-car garage, and a kidney-shaped pool out front. The lawn sprinklers chugged gently, the spouts of water illuminated by the porch lights. There was no sign of any cameras or hi-tech security stuff; just the yellow siren box from a cheapo burglar alarm, which would be switched off while anyone was in the house. James turned back towards Bruce.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get up here. It doesn&#x2019;t look too serious.&#x201d;<br> <br>James got out his wire cutters and snipped links in the fence until there was a slot big enough to squeeze through. He followed Bruce over the lawn, crawling swiftly towards the house. James felt something squish against his leg.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. man,&#x201d; James said, sounding totally revolted. &#x201c;Jesus.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bruce hushed him up. &#x201c;Quiet, for God&#x2019;s sake. What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just dragged my knee through a colossal pile of dog crap.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bruce couldn&#x2019;t help smiling. James looked set to puke.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is bad,&#x201d; Bruce said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me about it. I&#x2019;ve had it on my shoe before, but this is on my bare skin.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what a massive pile of dog mess means?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; James said. &#x201c;It means I&#x2019;m extremely pissed off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It also means there&#x2019;s a massive dog around here.&#x201d;<br> <br>The thought focused James&#x2019;s mind and got him crawling again. They stopped when they got to the wall of the villa, adjacent to a row of French doors. Bruce sat against the wall and checked out the room inside. The light was on. There were leather sofas and a snooker table inside. They tried sliding the French doors, but every one was locked. The keyholes were on the inside, so there was nothing to use their lock guns on.<br> <br>WOOF.<br> <br>The boys snapped their necks around. The mother of all rottweilers stood five meters away. The huge beast had muscles swelling through its shiny black coat and strings of drool hanging off its jaw.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice doggy,&#x201d; Bruce said, trying to keep calm.<br> <br>The growling dog moved closer, its black eyes staring them down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s a nice doggy-woggy?&#x201d; Bruce asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bruce, I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s gonna roll over and let you tickle its tummy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, what&#x2019;s your plan?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t show it any fear,&#x201d; James quaked. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll stare it down. It&#x2019;s probably as scared of us as we are of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Bruce said. &#x201c;You can tell. The poor thing&#x2019;s cacking itself.&#x201d;<br> <br>James began creeping backwards. The dog let out more volcanic barks. A metal hose reel clattered as James backed into it. He considered the reel for a second, before leaning over and unrolling a few meters of plastic hose. The dog was only a couple of steps away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bruce, you run off and try to open a door,&#x201d; James gasped. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try fending it off with this pipe.&#x201d;<br> <br>James half hoped the dog would go after Bruce, but it kept its eyes fixed, pacing closer to James until he could feel its damp breath on his legs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice doggy,&#x201d; James said.<br> <br>The rottweiler reared up on its back legs, trying to knock James over. James spun away and the paws squealed down the glass door. James lashed out with the hosepipe. It cracked against the dog&#x2019;s rib cage. The beast made a high-pitched yelp and backed up slightly. James cracked the pipe against the patio tiles, hoping the noise would scare the dog away, but if anything the whipping seemed to have made it crazier.<br> <br>James felt like his guts were going to drop out, imagining how easily the huge animal could rip into his flesh. James had nearly drowned once. He&#x2019;d thought nothing could ever be scarier, but this had the edge.<br> <br>A bolt clicked behind James&#x2019;s head and the French door glided open.<br> <br>&#x201c;Would Sir care to step inside?&#x201d; Bruce asked.<br> <br>James threw down the hose and leapt through the opening. Bruce rammed the door shut before the rottweiler made a move.<br> <br>&#x201c;What took you so long?&#x201d; James said anxiously, trying to stop his hands from shaking. &#x201c;Where is everyone?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No sign,&#x201d; Bruce said. &#x201c;Which is definitely weird. They&#x2019;d have to be deaf not to hear that psycho mutt barking at us.&#x201d;<br> <br>James grabbed one of the curtains and used it to wipe the dog crap off his leg.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s so gross,&#x201d; Bruce said. &#x201c;At least it&#x2019;s not on your clothes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you checked all the rooms out?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bruce shook his head. &#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d make sure you weren&#x2019;t being eaten first, even if it meant we got caught.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fair play,&#x201d; James said.<br> <br>They worked their way across the ground floor, creeping up to each door and checking out the rooms. The villa looked lived-in. There were cigarette butts in ashtrays and dirty mugs. There was a Mercedes in the garage. Bruce pocketed the keys.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s our getaway vehicle,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>There was no sign of life on the ground floor, which made the staircase likely to be some sort of trap. They stepped up gingerly, expecting someone to burst onto the landing pointing a gun at them.<br> <br>There were three bedrooms and a bathroom on the second floor. The two hostages were in the master bedroom. The eight-year-olds, Jake and Laura, were tied to a bedpost, with gags over their mouths. They wore grubby T-shirts and shorts.<br> <br>James and Bruce pulled the hunting knives off their belts and cut the kids loose. There was no time for greetings.<br> <br>&#x201c;Laura,&#x201d; James barked. &#x201c;When did you last see the bad guys? Have you got any idea where they might be?&#x201d;<br> <br>Laura was red-faced and seemed listless.<br> <br>&#x201c;I dunno,&#x201d; she shrugged. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m busting to pee.&#x201d;<br> <br>Laura and Jake knew nothing about anything. Bruce and James had been expecting a battle to get at them. This was far too easy.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re taking you to the car,&#x201d; James said.<br> <br>Laura started limping towards the bathroom. Her ankle was strapped up.<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have time for toilet breaks,&#x201d; James gasped. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got guns and we haven&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna wet my knickers in a minute,&#x201d; Laura said, bolting herself inside the en-suite bathroom.<br> <br>James was furious. &#x201c;Well, make it snappy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I need to go too,&#x201d; Jake said.<br> <br>Bruce shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you disappearing. You can pee in the corner of the garage while I start the car.&#x201d;<br> <br>He led Jake downstairs. James waited half a minute before thumping on the bathroom door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Laura, come on. What the hell is taking you so long?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m washing my hands,&#x201d; Laura said. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t find any soap.&#x201d;<br> <br>James couldn&#x2019;t believe it.<br> <br>&#x201c;For the love of God,&#x201d; he shouted, hammering his fist on the bolted door. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to get out of here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Laura eventually hobbled out of the bathroom.

It is your primer to the world of forex. It has been written to lay the foundations and provide the framework for getting started in the world of forex, in what I believe is the correct way. My other books then build on what you will learn here, to further develop your trading skills and knowledge.</p><p>What I try to do in all my books, is to show you how to apply that knowledge to help you become a more confident trader. After all, learning is all well and good, but if we are not taught how to apply that knowledge in a practical way, then it is of little use. It is the application of knowledge that empowers, and this is what I have tried to do here, and in my online training rooms, and all my books.</p><p>There are of course many books about forex trading. What is different about this book, is the focus on those aspects of trading which I believe are fundamental. After all, there are only two questions we need to answer when considering a position in the market:-</p><ul><li><em><strong>What is the risk on this trade - high, medium or low?</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>What is the financial risk on this trade?</strong></em></li></ul>The first is the hardest question to answer, and the book will explain in detail the analysis and approach to use, in order to answer this question with confidence. The second question is more straightforward and is answered provided you have an understanding of risk, money management and position sizing in relation to your trading capital. Again, this is covered in detail in the book. As the tag line on the front cover says <strong>'What you need to know to get started, and everything in between'</strong> which really sums up what you will learn.<p></p><p>The book explains everything, from the pure mechanics to the trading methodology that I advocate, and which I have used in all my own trading and investing for over 17 years. Forex For Beginners is also dedicated to all those traders who have asked me to write such an introduction, based on my knowledge and my methodology. <strong>This book is for you.</strong></p></p><p>Hi - my journey into the financial markets was prompted by a desire to make sense of the jargon filled replies I usually received when asking any financial adviser, the simplest of questions. Clearly they believed as a mere woman, I was incapable of understanding the complexities of the markets. This prompted my desire to learn, and since then I have been involved in every aspect of trading and investing for over seventeen years. Now at last, I have the luxury of time, to devote the next phase of my life to writing a series of books with one aim. To explain complex subjects and concepts surrounding the financial markets, in a clear and simple way. I actually began my professional life, as an English teacher. However, English was not my first language, having arrived in the UK from Italy at the tender age of three. At that time I spoke no English whatsoever, and my first memories are of my little village school in Scotland where I grew up, and where I learnt to read and write, chalk in hand! Very old fashioned, but what a wonderful way to learn. Since then, I have never stopped talking! - well I am Italian and as I&#39;m sure you know, Italians ALWAYS have an opinion on EVERYTHING!! Languages must be in my blood, as I also studied French and Spanish. I&#39;ve now transferred the &#39;teaching gene&#39; into written form through the power of Amazon. I hope, that whether you are a trader, investor or a speculator, you will find one, or perhaps more, of my books useful in your own approach to the markets.

To start off, I was surprised. The phrase seemed to belong to a character in a smart New York TV sitcom. Yet real people were using it to describe something profound that was happening to their relationship. But how could someone love but not be <em>in </em>love? These couples would describe each other as best friends or that their relationship was more like a brother and sister, except most were still having sex. In essence, the partnership had become defined by companionship rather than passion&#x2015;and that was no longer enough. </p> <p><strong>COUPLE #1 </strong></p> <p>Nick is, a forty-two-year-old sales manager, and Anna, a thirty-nine-year-old teacher. They had been married for fifteen years and despite some difficult patches, like Nick's layoff, their relationship had flourished. </p> <p>So when Nick dropped the, 'I love you, but' bombshell, Anna was devastated: 'I thought we had a happy relationship, I really did. Not perfect, of course, but then who can claim that? I've tried to get him to explain why he doesn't love me anymore, but he keeps saying he doesn't know. The best he has managed is that I don't listen. Except, he's never told me before he was unhappy.' </p> <p>Nick explained that the feeling had been building for several years and that he needed to tell their two teenage children and have a trial separation. 'He has no honor, no loyalty,' Anna complained. 'He is completely selfish. I feel he's leaving me for someone he hasn't even met yet.' </p> <p><strong>COUPLE #2 </strong></p> <p>Michael and Elizabeth are both in their late thirties and have been together since their late teens. 'I no longer feel I'm special to Elizabeth ,' complained Michael. 'I know we have responsibilities, but we used to be everything to each other. Now I seem to come way down on the list. I might joke that I come after the kids' guinea pigs, but it's not really very funny.' </p> <p>Michael had been feeling like this for several years and had withdrawn into himself. At first, Elizabeth thought there might have been someone else, but finally, Michael confessed that he loved her but was no longer in love and was considering leaving. 'We're not a couple of kids sharing french fries in a bus shelter anymore,' she moaned. 'It can't be how it used to be. Just think of all the things I do for you&#x2015;cooking, cleaning, ironing. Do you think I feel special every day? Life isn't like that.' Michael and Elizabeth were both talking about love but had very different definitions. </p> <p>With no agreement about what constitutes love, their conversations went around in circles. ILYB is especially frustrating when there is much to celebrate in the relationship. </p> <p><strong>ILYB </strong></p> <p>Irene is sixty-one and has been with her husband for over thirty-five years. She lives in Toronto , Ontario , and is one of the respondents to a questionnaire I circulated throughout North America . </p> <p>'We are good friends and have wonderful conversations about everything, but I can't pretend that I wouldn't be happier if the passionate and affectionate sides of myself could be expressed and received,' writes Irene. 'But I no longer know how to deal with that. I try to show my love in other ways, but the truth is, at times I still feel bereft.' With most problems, when someone has the courage to admit everything, he or she expects to be greeted with sympathy and understanding. </p> <p>Sadly, people who have fallen out of love are often told just to try harder. Naomi is thirty-four and comes from New Jersey : 'My soul is lost, and I am almost emotionally dead. I confided in my mother, but she just reminded me that I have a wonderful husband who loves his children. </p> <p>She's right. But I just cannot let love into my heart. I want it so badly but just don't know what to do.' Instead of feeling supported, Naomi feels more alone than ever before and is no further forward in finding a solution. Almost every popular song is about love, as are half of all novels and films; we read about it or see it on TV every day. Surely, we should understand love and, at the very least, be able to define it. But this is where the confusion starts. We can love our mothers, our children, and our friends&#x2015;even chocolate. </p> <p>When it comes to our partners, love can describe both the crazy, heady days at the beginning of a relationship and ten years later, taking his or her hand, squeezing it, and feeling sure of each other. Can one little word really cover so many different emotions? Dictionaries are not much help. They list almost two dozen synonyms&#x2015;including affection, fondness, caring, liking, concern, attraction, desire, and infatuation, and we all instinctively agree there is a huge gap between 'liking' and complete 'infatuation.' The problem is that we have one word for three very different emotions: the early days/honeymoon passion; the day-to-day intimacy with a long-term partner; and the protective instinct for a child or bond with a parent. To clarify the differences between these three types, we need a new vocabulary, partly to remove the confusion between two partners with different takes&#x2015;like Elizabeth and Michael&#x2015;but mainly because by naming and explaining the differences, we will understand love better. <br> <br> </p> <p>--- </p> <p>�2007.

Learn more about him at www.mauricebroaddus.com.</p>Gr 6-8-Middle-school pranksters Thelonius Mitchell and his best friend Nehemiah have been labeled "emotionally delinquent" and put in Mr. Blackmon's special education classroom, where they feel they're always taking the heat for things that aren't their fault (in fairness, they take the heat for some that are, too). When a handgun is discovered on the grounds of a nearby playground, the students in the special education class are the first ones hauled in for the principal's line of questioning. As Nehemiah and Thelonius work together to clear their names, they uncover information that has the power to exonerate them-but it also implicates a classmate who may not deserve to take the fall. Broaddus's experience as a teacher is front and center here; Thelonius's world and his self-awareness as he interacts with the adults around him (particularly Mr. Blackmon) provide insight into contemporary special education, and the thought processes of neuroatypical students and students with learning disabilities. Though the large cast of characters and uneven pacing makes narrowing down the culprit of the gun incident difficult, fans of whodunits with a social conscience will find lots to like here. VERDICT Broaddus's first foray into middle grade fiction is an overall success that provides a rare and much-needed glimpse into the world of exceptional learners.-Katherine Barr, Cameron Village Regional Library, Raleigh, NC&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Victoria's matchmaking plans were further complicated by the tumultuous international upheavals of the time: revolution and war were in the air, and kings and queens, princes and princesses were vulnerable targets.<br><i>Queen Victoria's Matchmaking</i> travels through the glittering, decadent palaces of Europe from London to Saint Petersburg, weaving in scandals, political machinations and family tensions to enthralling effect. It is at once an intimate portrait of a royal family and an examination of the conflict caused by the marriages the Queen arranged. At the heart of it all is Victoria herself: doting grandmother one moment, determined Queen Empress the next.</p><p><b>Deborah Cadbury</b> is the author of eight acclaimed books, including <i>Chocolate Wars</i>; <i>The Dinosaur Hunters</i>; <i>The Lost King of France</i>; <i>Seven Wonders of the Industrial World</i>, for which her accompanying BBC series received a BAFTA nomination; and <i>Princes at War</i>.

As work and organizations have become more fluid--and business strategy is no longer about planning years ahead but about sensing and seizing new opportunities and adapting to a constantly changing environment--companies must deploy talent in new ways to remain competitive.</p><p>Turning conventional views on their heads, talent and leadership experts Ram Charan, Dominic Barton, and Dennis Carey provide leaders with a new and different playbook for acquiring, managing, and deploying talent--for today's agile, digital, analytical, technologically driven strategic environment--and for creating the HR function that business needs. Filled with examples of forward-thinking companies that have adopted radical new approaches to talent (such as ADP, Amgen, BlackRock, Blackstone, Haier, ING, Marsh, Tata Communications, Telenor, and Volvo), as well as the juggernauts and the startups of Silicon Valley, this book shows leaders how to bring the rigor that they apply to financial capital to their human capital--elevating HR to the same level as finance in their organizations.</p><p>Providing deep, expert insight and advice for what needs to change and how to change it, this is the definitive book for reimagining and creating a talent-driven organization that wins.</p></p><p><p><b>Ram Charan</b>&#x200e; is an expert on corporate governance, author of four bestsellers (<i>Execution</i>, <i>Confronting Reality</i>, <i>The Attacker's Advantage</i>, and <i>Boards That Lead</i>), and winner of best-teacher awards at Northwestern and GE.

Anyone within earshot of Paul and the woman sitting across from him at the poolside table would have thought they&#x2019;d known each other for years, al�though the pair had met only two days prior. They talked about everything from world travel to the 1970s antiwar movement to Socratic philosophy; their conversation had a casual, easy flow to it. Watching the two of&nbsp; them&#x2014; Nadia with her fine Mediterranean features and striking&nbsp; jet- black hair and Paul with his rugged, all- American&nbsp; looks&#x2014; one had a sense that they fi t together. It was as if each was at�tuned to what the other was thinking. One moment they were laughing at embarrassing childhood stories and the next they were finishing each other&#x2019;s sentences. If there&#x2019;s such a thing as synergy between two people, it seemed al�most palpable here.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would never have suspected that the two were os�tensibly meeting for work. At the time, Paul was in charge of the proposal for a $15 billion project to clean up a nu�clear weapons facility in Colorado. To help put the pro�posal together, Paul had assembled experts from around the world. The team had taken over an office building in Pasadena; the work was so intense that the office remained open 24/7. It was Paul&#x2019;s role to make sure all the count�less moving parts worked together. But he was used to this level of intensity. A former officer in the army&#x2019;s special forces, Paul was trained to make split- second decisions, and he has the kind of personality people instinctively re�spond to&#x2014; he is a natural leader. In conversation, he fo�cuses intently on the other person&#x2019;s every word, making it clear he&#x2019;s fully present and is listening carefully.<br>Every morning at exactly 8:15 a.m., Paul assembled the top executives from the team to brief them about the strat�egy for the day. The meeting several days ago, though, had been different. From the beginning, Paul was keenly aware of the new team member, Nadia. &#x201c;I immediately thought, <i>Who is that?</i>&#x201d; He found himself instantly attracted to her. Nadia&#x2019;s initial reaction to Paul seemed to be very differ�ent, however. It was her first day on the job. Her vacation in Paris had been abruptly cut short so that she could fl y to Pasadena and take over as the project&#x2019;s chief operat�ing officer. If that&nbsp; hadn&#x2019;t soured her mood enough, Paul made a comment during the meeting&#x2014; seemingly out of left field&#x2014; that soured it further.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I uttered something about there being nothing new in human relations since the time of Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates,&#x201d; he recalled. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even remember why.&#x201d; <br>A few minutes later, as Paul stood before the group, he noticed out of the corner of his eye a folded note being passed from person to person. As he continued speaking, the note eventually made its way to him. He unfolded it and read the first line: &#x201c;I completely disagree with you.&#x201d; The hand- scrawled note went on for an entire page. But it was unsigned. He looked up, searching for a nod from the note&#x2019;s author. But all he got were blank stares. Only after the meeting had ended and the rest of his staff had fi led out of the room did Nadia walk up to Paul.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembers Nadia, &#x201c;Here we haven&#x2019;t met yet, and I just wrote him a note that said, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t agree with you; what about the change in master- slave relations and relation�ships between men and women? There have been so many advances in society since then. How can you make such a comment? I&#x2019;d like to discuss this with you.&#x2019; &#x201d; <br>Paul, instead of becoming defensive, was intrigued. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to continue the conversation with you,&#x201d; he told her.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Anytime,&#x201d; she fired back.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve hours later they were sitting by the pool.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had told themselves that they intended to use the time not just to resolve the argument but also to delve into some important work issues. Work, however, never came up during their conversation together. Toward the end of the evening, the intensity of their interaction was difficult to ignore. <br>&#x201c;Are we going to end up getting in trouble?&#x201d; Paul asked Nadia, realizing that they were letting work get away from them. <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said simply. It was clear to her from the be�ginning that there was something special between them. &#x201c;The moment he made that comment about Plato and Aris�totle,&#x201d; she told us, &#x201c;I knew. What we valued in life was very much the same, as were the things we thought were trivial. Who&#x2019;s outrageous enough to even bring up Plato and Aris�totle in the middle of a strategy session? I mean, what does anybody who&#x2019;s in there know about Plato and the Greeks, or care about them? He had that courage to be different.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having accomplished little of the work they had been planning to do, the pair decided to meet again the follow�ing night by the pool. And it was then that it happened. Paul looked at Nadia and asked, &#x201c;What would you say if I told you that I loved you and wanted to marry you?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadia retorted, &#x201c;Is that a hypothetical or is that an offer?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see what tomorrow brings.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&#x2019;s hit the pause button here. First, it&#x2019;s worth noting that Paul and Nadia weren&#x2019;t teenagers driven by hyperac�tive hormones. They were seasoned business executives. Like most of us, when they met a new person, they usu�ally spent their first moments sizing each other up, search�ing for something to talk about: <i>Where are you from? What kind of work do you do?&nbsp;</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, though, an introduction to someone new is more intense and intimate from the get- go. Maybe we share the same sense of humor or we admire the other in�dividual&#x2019;s personality or passion. Or we immediately sense that we can just be ourselves around that person. Things feel right; we hit it off. There is an immediate sense of fa�miliarity and comfort. Conversation flows easily, without embarrassing pauses or self- consciousness. In essence, we click. <br>This book is about those mysterious moments&#x2014; when we click in life. Those moments when we are fully engaged and feel a certain natural chemistry or connection with a person, place, or activity.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its simplest terms, clicking can be defined as an im�mediate, deep, and meaningful connection with another person or with the world around us. Typically, it takes weeks or months before most of us feel truly comfortable with a new person. We have to gain the other person&#x2019;s trust, and he or she needs to gain ours. We need to find a common language, understand each other&#x2019;s quirks, and establish an emotional bond. But sometimes this process is greatly accelerated, and the connection seems to form almost magically and instantaneously.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this type of immediate, deep connection isn&#x2019;t lim�ited to romantic love. Clicking can be equally deep and meaningful between future friends and can strike in the most unlikely of places.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Jim West and Gerhard Sessler, a pair of physicists who first met at Bell Laboratories, the instant connection between them would permanently alter the course of their careers. But if you were to go back to 1959 and see the two when they first met, you&#x2019;d be struck by their apparent differences. <br>Jim, a tall, slender African American who grew up in Virginia during the Great Depression, learned from an early age to make do with whatever resources were available to him. &#x201c;As a black man,&#x201d; he reflected, &#x201c;I attended segregated schools. But I was lucky in that I had great teachers.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These teachers&#x2014; along with his family, friends, and neighbors&#x2014; saw something special in the boy. As his brother tells it, Jim was the kind of kid who always had a screwdriver or tool of some sort in his hand. When he wasn&#x2019;t taking apart his grandfather&#x2019;s watch, he was rebuild�ing an old vacuum- tube radio. As a teenager, Jim decided to channel his love of tinkering into a career in physics. Concerned, his father introduced him to three black men who held Ph.D.&#x2019;s in physics or chemistry. Recalls Jim, &#x201c;The best jobs they could find were at the post office. [The point my father was making was that] I was taking the long road toward working at the post office.&#x201d; <br>Jim persevered nonetheless, eventually landing a job at Bell Laboratories. It was the equivalent, for an engineer, of working at Disneyland. &#x201c;It was the premier research insti�tute in the country,&#x201d; Jim explains. &#x201c;People from all over the world wanted to work there.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first day at Bell Labs, Jim was assigned an office next door to another new recruit, Gerhard Sessler. Sport�ing short- cropped hair and a fastidious wardrobe, Gerhard had a natural, genteel warmth about him. While Jim had been raised in the American South, Gerhard had grown up in pre&#x2013;World War II Germany. &#x201c;I was only eight years old when the war started,&#x201d; recalls Gerhard. &#x201c;The air raids, the atmosphere&#x2014; it was a very difficult time.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very unusual in 1959 for an African American man from the South to be working side by side with a Ger�man immigrant. But the two immediately hit it off. Even though Gerhard&#x2019;s thick German accent was difficult for Jim&#x2019;s American ears to understand, from the beginning the pair launched into long discussions about physics and life. As Gerhard tells it, &#x201c;From the start, I noticed Jim was intel�lectually curious and sharp&#x2014; always exploring new things. I was immediately drawn to that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We were both new,&#x201d; recalls Jim, &#x201c;and being a member of an underrepresented minority, it was unusually lonely. But with Gerhard, I knew I could always be myself. I think it&#x2019;s fair to say that we clicked right off the bat.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two spent hours discussing science and theories of the natural world, and the more they talked, the more intense the interaction became. In the course of one of these impassioned conversations, the two came up with an ingenious idea, one that would lead to one of the great�est achievements in acoustics history: the invention of the modern microphone.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing Jim and Gerhard&#x2019;s story with Paul and Nadia&#x2019;s, we see two very different types of relationships emerging. But if we take a close look at the two budding relationships, we see that they follow a similar trajectory. Both began with what we call <i>quick- set intimacy</i>. In other contexts, the words <i>quick</i> and <i>instant </i>don&#x2019;t necessarily sound like positive descriptions (think instant coffee or quick TV dinners). But when it comes to human relation�ships, the bonds formed by quick- set intimacy can be sur�prisingly strong and create a tenor in the relationship that may be lifelong. In our exploration of clicking, we&#x2019;ll inves�tigate the different factors that go into forming&nbsp; quick- set intimacy. What happens in that moment when we first sense our interest in another person? Why do we click with some people and not with others? Why do those moments make us feel more fully connected not just to that individ�ual but to everything around us? Is there a way to foster or proactively create that kind of instant intimacy? <br>When we click in a relationship&#x2014; whether the relation�ship is a romantic one or involves meeting a new friend at a party or forging a special connection with a teammate or colleague&#x2014; we are affected in several significant ways. First, clicking brings about a unique, almost euphoric state, one that we describe as &#x201c;magical.&#x201d; Second, it perma�nently alters the fundamental nature of the relationship. And last, it can serve to elevate our own personal abilities. <br>Let&#x2019;s look at what actually happens when&nbsp; quick- set inti�macy takes place. Paul remembers that the moment he met Nadia, he felt an overwhelming attraction to her. Nadia puts it slightly differently. She felt an instant sense of com�fort and a surprising intensity of feeling: &#x201c;The attraction was just magical.&#x201d; And neither Paul nor Nadia uses words such as <i>magical </i>loosely&#x2014; Paul was a former military officer, you&#x2019;ll recall, and Nadia was a senior manager with a degree in nuclear engineering. <br>The two physicists at Bell Labs expressed a similar in�tensity. &#x201c;Somehow, from the very, very start,&#x201d; reflects Ger�hard, &#x201c;there was always sympathy for the other person. There was always an understanding. We had such an ap�preciation for each other.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us have had that feeling of magic at some time in our lives. But it can be difficult to articulate. The next time you encounter someone whom you instantly, magi�cally hit it off with, pay attention to what you are experienc�ing in that moment. There&#x2019;s a certain quality of infatuation; it is exciting, even thrilling. We often feel more alive, more engaged, more <i>there. </i>We&#x2019;re more in touch with the other person, or with our surroundings, and with ourselves.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neuroscientists decided to try to take a peek into the bi�ology behind clicking in a romantic context. The research�ers scoured the community for individuals who identified themselves as being &#x201c;madly in love.&#x201d; When they placed these people in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine to scan their brains, they observed that the parts of their brains responsible for dopamine absorp�tion were extraordinarily active&#x2014; so much so that the indi�viduals almost looked like they were under the influence of narcotics. Dopamine is the chemical that fuels the brain&#x2019;s pleasure center, producing the kind of euphoria we asso�ciate with feeling fully alive. This is a noticeable and sig�nificant high&#x2014; and from a strictly biological perspective, it has an allure not unlike that of such drugs as cocaine, nicotine, and amphetamines.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time we feel that sense of being fully engaged and alive, whether as a result of a connection with an�other person, an activity such as sports&#x2014; being &#x201c;in the zone&#x201d;&#x2014;or simply feeling at one with the world around us, we experience a surge of dopamine through our brain. The magnitude of the chemical reward we get when we make these intimate connections stands in stark contrast to our complete lack of such a reward when we are feel�ing socially disconnected. To study this effect, a team of neuroscientists from UCLA and Australia placed partici�pants in fMRI machines and asked them to play a virtual ball- tossing game. In the game, participants were under the impression that they were playing electronic catch with other participants in the room. But in reality they were just playing with a computer. After a few rounds, the computer deliberately ignored the participants by no lon�ger tossing the ball to them. If being madly in love floods the brain with dopamine, feeling cut off and&nbsp; alone&#x2014; even in the course of a simple game of virtual catch&#x2014; lit up the anterior cingulate cortex, the part of the brain associated with physical pain.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the brain go to such extremes to reward us fo...</p></p><h2>Barack Obama: Quotable Wisdom</h2><p><b><i>&#x201c;[D]emocracy isn&#x2019;t a spectator sport.

Groberg shares experiences of ordinary people along with insights about temple worship gained during his service as president of the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple. During that time, he often heard people express their wish that they didn&#39;t have to go back to the &#34;real world.&#34; He teaches that what we do and experience in the temple is lasting and eternal, and therefore the temple is the real world. The mortal world we live in is only temporary and, therefore, not &#34;real.&#34; Through his inspiring stories, we learn how temple worship allows us to view life with an eternal perspective, how we can make the temple a bigger part of our lives, and how we can enjoy a sense of restoration and refuge by performing service in the temple. Elder John H. Groberg was called to the First Quorum of the Seventy in April 1976. Since that time, he has served in assignments all over the globe. He is the author of Anytime, Anywhere, The Other Side of Heaven, and The Fire of Faith.

But the mission to collect the immigrants becomes a rescue operation when it is revealed that InterGal is doing nothing to help these survivors of a world devastated by a meteor shower. Murel and Ronan set out to persuade the frightened refugees to come out of hiding, leave their world, and bring along their sacred totem animals, the gifted sea turtles called the Honus. But the twins discover that they&#x2019;ve taken on more than they expected: The Honus are not the only animals sacred to the refugees.

Patterns are everywhere in nature, and counting, measuring, and calculating changes are as old as civilization itself, as are many of the theorems and laws of math. The Pythagorean Theorem was used to plot out fields for planting crops before the ancient Greek Pythagoras was even born, but the story begins long before that, with tally marks on rock and bone surviving from the Stone Age. Here is the essential guide to mathematics, an authoritative reference book and timeline that explores the work of history s greatest mathematicians. From the teasing genius of Pierre de Fermat, who said he knew the answers but rarely gave them up, to the fractal pattern discovered by Waclaw Sierpinski now used to plan the route a mailman takes, here are 100 landmark moments in this intensely rigorous discipline, seen through the eyes of the people who lived them. Glimpse the abstract landscape of infinite numbers and multi-dimensional shapes as you learn about the most famous math men of all. Pythagoras had a love of numbers so strong it led to a violent death. Then there is Fibonacci, whose guide for bookkeepers changed the way we add and Descartes, who took inspiration from a fly to convert numbers into shapes and back again, changing math forever. Over many centuries, great minds puzzled over the evidence and, step-by-step, edged ever closer to the truth. Behind every one of these breakthrough moments there s a story about a confounding puzzle that became a discovery and changed the way we see the world. Here are one hundred of the most significant and we call these Ponderables. In Mathematics: An Illustrated History of Numbers, you ll get a peak into the Imponderables, too, the mysteries yet to be solved that will one day lead great thinkers forward to an even greater understanding of the universe. Includes a removable fold-out concertina neatly housed in the back of the book. This fold-out provides a 12-page Timeline History of Mathematics that embeds the story in historical context and shows Who Did What When at a glance.

The assessment of the generals and political leaders, as well as of the wranglings within both the Allied and Axis commands, is completely unsparing.

It then demonstrates that this medical figure became an archetype for the "sexual anarchy" of the Modernist period in works by&nbsp; Aldous Huxley, James Joyce, Djuna Barnes, T. S. Eliot, and Jean Genet.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thus illuminating the trans feminine's Modernist provenance, the book examines foundational works of Queer Theory that resuscitated the trans feminine allegory at the end of the twentieth century. Insightful and seminal, <i>The New Woman </i>debunks the pervasive reflex beginning in the 1990s to connect trans experience to a late twentieth-century collapse of sexual differences by revealing the Modernist roots of that very formulation.</p><p><b>EMMA HEANEY</b> is an assistant professor of English at William Paterson University"<i>The New Woman&nbsp;</i>is an exciting breakthrough for scholars and armchair readers alike who are seeking to put the femme in feminist studies, lesbian studies, and even queer theory."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>LambdaLiterary</i><br><br> "Heaney provides insightful and informed analyses of a wide range of writings from the modernist era, in the context of medical, psychoanalytic, feminist and material challenges to binary notions of gender and sex. Reading what she terms a 'trans feminine archive' of first-person accounts, Heaney argues against the figural appropriation of the trans feminine, detailing a range of trans experience and the various ways individuals have related to their bodies and sex experiences. Her argument is compelling, important, and timely."&#x2014;Pamela L. Caughie, author of <i>Virginia Woolf and Postmodernism: Literature in Quest and Question of Itself</i><br><br>"While trans masculine studies have helped to redefine both Queer Theory and literary Modernism, trans feminist studies have largely been absent. The theoretical insights of this book will provide an original and long overdue addition to the fields of Queer Theory, Modernism, and twentieth-century literary and cultural studies."&#x2014;Jaime E. Hovey, author of <i>A Thousand Words: Portraiture, Style, and Queer Modernism</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br>"In a thoughtful, provocative analysis of the transfeminine, Heaney draws on diverse literary, autobiographical, medical, psychoanalytical, and theoretical sources, from the late 19th century to the present, to refute monolithic, demeaning views of transfeminine experiences and culture.&nbsp;Especially illuminating are case histories and life writing, which afford ample evidence to counter assumptions, held by many cis heterosexuals, that trans females are isolated, persecuted, and abused.&nbsp;Heaney&#x2019;s title alludes to the rebellious new woman of the early 20th century, a transitional figure seeking redefinition and liberation from constricting roles.

Each title features a "pull-out wall frieze" with eight dual-sided stand-up card stock pages. One side of the concertina panels is a continuum of eye-catching and intriguing facts about historic, geographic, cultural, natural, and modern points of interest. These numbered, illustrated landmarks are sequentially located along (or near) the blue/green ribbon of the Nile and along the serpentine brick/stone/earthworks of the Great Wall. Artwork is crisp, colorful, and culturally distinctive and complements the engaging, informative text. The backsides of the illustrated panels offer more detailed information. Younger students will enjoy browsing these visually rich, readable travelogues which are best viewed by unfolding and displaying the entire concertina book at once. However, the lack of an index for accessing the diverse array of facts inhibits quick reference or research. VERDICT These illustrated travel titles will spark interest in natural and man-made wonders, but they are not easily handled, refolded, or referenced. In a school setting, they may be best shared in learning centers and displays.&#x2014;Gerry Larson, formerly at Durham School of the Arts, NC</p><h2>The Blue Star</h2><p>The alternate Earth of &#34;The Blue Star&#34; is no home to swashbucklers or soldiers. It&#39;s a carefully worked out society, approximating the 18th-century Austro-Hungarian Empire. In this world, gunpowder has not been discovered, but magic works. The Empire centered around the city of Netzigon is corrupt, collapsing, decadent, and basically tiresome. The novel follows the adventures of Rodvard Bergelin, who begins as an ineffecutal, milquetoast government clerk and becomes embroiled in a massive plot to pull the Empire down and rebuild a free society.

Crowe brings the same wry humor he brought to <i>Jerry Maguire</i> as well as the brilliant evocations of teen life that animated his earlier cult film <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i> to chronicle and celebrate a pivotal moment in rock history-and one teenage boy's place in it.<br></p><p><b>Cameron Crowe</b> is among the most successful writer/directors in Hollywood today.

Most of us take it for granted. We just do it--whether it's trusting that the sun will come up tomorrow, that the lunch we are about to eat is not poisoned or that our religious beliefs are not ill-founded. But why should we believe any of these things? Why should anyone believe anything at all? With insight and humor, James W. Sire examines the reasons people give for believing what they do and suggests what are truly satisfying and compelling reasons for belief. He then turns to the question of a specific belief--namely, belief that the Christian faith is true. Sire tackles both the best reason for belief in Christianity (the identity of Jesus ) and the chief reason against it (the problem of evil). And he responds to these issues personally and philosophically. Here is a book to challenge the skeptic and reassure the doubter in us all.</p><p>With insight and humor, James Sire takes a look at the actual reasons people give for believing what they do. He then probes further to suggest more satisfying and compelling reasons for belief. Having explored the issue of belief in general, he turns to the question of believing that the Christian faith is true. Central to Christianity&#39;s truth claims, he argues, is the person of Jesus Christ. What can we know about him? Why should we believe what we read about him is true? Not content just to suggest reasons for belief, Sire tackles the chief reason against it - the problem of evil. No mere armchair theologian, he responds to this tough question personally as well as philosophically. Here is a book to challenge the skeptic and reassure the doubter in us all.James W.

From Rome to Greece and to Egypt itself, most of civilization is on the verge of war. The young Gordianus&#x2015;a born-and-raised Roman citizen&#x2015;is living in Alexandria, making ends meet by plying his trade of solving puzzles and finding things out for pay. He whiles away his time with his slave Bethesda, waiting for the world to regain its sanity. But on the day Gordianus turns twenty-two, Bethesda is kidnapped by brigands who mistake her for a rich man's mistress. If Gordianus is to find and save Bethesda, who has come to mean more to him than even he suspected, he must find the kidnappers before they realize their mistake and cut their losses. Using all the skills he learned from his father, Gordianus must track them down and convince them that he can offer something of enough value in exchange for Bethesda's release.</p><p>As the streets of Alexandria slowly descend into chaos, and the citizenry begin to riot with rumors of an impending invasion by Ptolmey's brother, Gordianus finds himself in the midst of a very bold and dangerous plot&#x2015;the raiding and pillaging of the golden sarcophagus of Alexander the Great himself.</p><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Steven Saylor returns, chronicling the early years of his detective, Gordianus, before he assumed the title of The Finder. <i>Raiders of the Nile</i> is the latest in his much-loved series of mysteries set in the late Roman Republic.</p></p><p><p>STEVEN SAYLOR is the author of acclaimed historical mystery novels featuring Gordianus the Finder, including <i>The Triumph of Caesar</i>, as well as the internationally bestselling historical novels <i>Empire</i> and <i>Roma</i>.

He divides his time between Berkeley, California, and Austin, Texas.</p>I <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Like any young Roman who found himself living in the most exciting city on earth&#x2014;Alexandria, capital of Egypt&#x2014;I had a long list of things I wanted to do, but taking part in a raid to steal the golden sarcophagus of Alexander the Great had never been among them. <br>And yet, there I found myself, on a morning in the month we Romans call Maius, doing just that. <br>The tomb of the city&#x2019;s founder is located in a massive, ornate building in the heart of the city. A towering frieze along one side depicts the exploits of the world conqueror. The moment of inspiration that gave birth to the city itself, some 240 years ago, is vividly depicted on the frieze: Alexander stands atop a sand dune, staring at the shore and the sea beyond while his architects, surveyors, and engineers gaze up at him in wonder, clutching their various instruments. <br>So realistically sculpted and painted was this massive frieze that I almost expected the giant image of the conqueror to suddenly turn his head and peer down at us as we scurried below him, heading toward the building&#x2019;s entrance. I would not have been surprised to see him raise an eyebrow and inquire in a booming, godlike voice, &#x201c;Where in Hades do you fellows think you&#x2019;re going? Why are some of you brandishing swords? And what is that the rest of you carry&#x2014;a battering ram?&#x201d; <br>But Alexander remained immobile and mute as my companions and I rushed past him and surged into the colonnaded entranceway. <br>On this day the tomb was closed to visitors. An iron gate barred entry to the vestibule. I was among those who carried the battering ram. We pivoted into formation, perpendicular to the gate. As Artemon, our leader, counted to three, we heaved the ram forward, then back, then forward again with all our might. The gate shuddered and buckled at the impact. <br>&#x201c;Again!&#x201d; shouted Artemon. &#x201c;On my count! One&#x2014;two&#x2014; <i>three</i>!&#x201d; <br>Each time the ram butted against it, the gate moaned and shrieked, as if it were a living thing. On our fourth heave, the gate flew open. Those of us carrying the battering ram retreated back into the street and tossed it aside while the vanguard of our party, led by Artemon, rushed through the sundered gate. I drew my sword and followed them into the vestibule. Dazzling mosaics celebrating the life of Alexander decorated every surface from the floor to the domed ceiling high above, where an opening admitted sunlight to shimmer across the millions of pieces of colored glass and stone. <br>Ahead of me, I saw that only a handful of armed men offered resistance. These guardians of the tomb looked surprised, frightened, and ready to run&#x2014;and who could blame them? We greatly outnumbered them. They also looked rather old to be bearing arms, with weathered, wrinkled faces and gray eyebrows. <br>Why were there so few guards, and why were they of such a low grade? Artemon had told us that the city was in chaos, wracked by daily riots. All the most able-bodied soldiers had been summoned by King Ptolemy to protect the royal palace, leaving only this feeble handful to defend the Tomb of Alexander. Perhaps the king thought that even the most violent mob would never dare to violate such a sacred place, especially in broad daylight. But Artemon had out-foxed him. &#x201c;Our greatest advantage will be the element of surprise,&#x201d; he had told us, and it appeared that he was correct. <br>I heard a clash of swords, followed by screams. I had deliberately volunteered to man the battering ram, so as to avoid being on the front line of whatever battle might take place. I wanted no blood on my hands, if I could possibly avoid it. But was I really less guilty than my comrades ahead of me, who were gleefully hacking away with their swords? <br>You may wonder why I was taking part in such a criminal act. I had been compelled to join these bandits against my will. Still, might I not have slipped away at some point and escaped? Why did I stay with them? Why did I continue to follow Artemon&#x2019;s orders? Did I do so out of fear, or misplaced loyalty, or simple greed for the share of gold we had all been promised? <br>No. I did what I did for <i>her</i>&#x2014;for the sake of that crazy slave girl who had somehow got herself kidnapped by these bandits. <br>What sort of Roman would stoop to such criminal behavior for the sake of a girl, and a mere slave at that? The blinding Egyptian sun must have driven me mad, that I should find myself in such a spot! <br>As I rushed through the vestibule, toward the wide corridor that led to the sarcophagus, I realized I was whispering her name: &#x201c;Bethesda!&#x201d; Was she still well, and unharmed? Would I ever see her again? <br>I slipped on a pool of blood. As I spun my arms to balance myself, I looked down and saw the pale face of a fallen guard. His lifeless eyes were wide open and his mouth was set in a grimace. The poor old fellow might have been someone&#x2019;s grandfather! <br>One of my companions helped to steady me. <i>Careless fool!</i> I thought. <i>You might have broken your neck! You might have fallen on your own sword! What would have become of Bethesda then?</i> <br>I heard the sounds of another battle ahead of us, but its duration was brief. By the time I stepped into the chamber, only one guard remained standing, and even as I watched, Artemon stabbed him in the belly. The poor fellow crumpled lifeless to the hard granite floor. His sword fell beside him with a clatter, and then a hush fell over the crowded room. <br>Lamps set in niches in the walls provided the only illumination. Though it was bright daylight outside, here all was dim light and shadow. Before us, raised upon a low dais, was a massive sarcophagus. In form and style it was partly Egyptian, like the angular mummy cases of the ancient pharaohs, and partly Greek, with carvings along the sides that depicted the exploits of Alexander&#x2014;the taming of the steed Bucephalus, the triumphal entry into the Gates of Babylon, the terrifying battle with the elephant cavalry of the Indus. The gleaming sarcophagus, made of solid gold, was encrusted with precious stones, including the dazzling green gem called the emerald mined from the mountains of southernmost Egypt. The sarcophagus glittered in the flickering light of the lamps, an object of breathtaking splendor and of value beyond calculation. <br>&#x201c;Well, what do you make of that?&#x201d; <br>I shivered, as if startled from a dream. Artemon stood beside me. His bright eyes sparkled and his handsome features seemed to glow in the ruddy light. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s magnificent,&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;More magnificent than I ever imagined.&#x201d; <br>He grinned, flashing perfect white teeth, then raised his voice. &#x201c;Did you hear that, men? Even our Roman comrade is impressed! And Pecunius&#x201d;&#x2014;that was the name by which he knew me&#x2014;&#x201c;is not easily impressed, for has he not seen the Seven Wonders of the World, as he never tires of telling us? What do you say, Pecunius&#x2014;is this sarcophagus the equal of those Wonders?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Can it really be made of solid gold?&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;The weight must be enormous!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yet we have the means to move it.&#x201d; <br>Even as Artemon spoke, some of the men brought forth winches, pulleys, lengths of rope, and wooden shims. Another group appeared from the vestibule wheeling a sturdy wagon down the wide corridor. The wagon was loaded with a lidded wooden crate made especially for our cargo. Artemon had thought of everything. Suddenly he looked to me like the young Alexander as depicted on the frieze of the building, a visionary surrounded by adoring architects and engineers. Artemon knew what he wanted and had a plan to achieve it. He inspired fear in his enemies and confidence in his followers. He knew how to bend others to his will. Certainly he had succeeded at making me do as he wanted, against all my better judgment. <br>The wagon was wheeled into place alongside the dais. The top of the crate was lifted off. The inside was padded with blankets and straw. <br>A hoisting mechanism was deployed to remove the lid of the sarcophagus. <br>&#x201c;Should we be opening the sarcophagus?&#x201d; I said, feeling a prickle of superstitious dread. <br>&#x201c;The lid and the sarcophagus are both very heavy,&#x201d; said Artemon. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be easier to manipulate if we separate them and lift them one at a time.&#x201d; <br>As the lid began to rise above the sarcophagus, a thought occurred to me. <br>&#x201c;What will become of the body?&#x201d; I asked. <br>Artemon looked at me sidelong but did not speak. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to hold it for ransom, are you?&#x201d; <br>He laughed at the look on my face. &#x201c;Of course not. The remains of Alexander will be handled with utmost respect, and will be left here where they belong, in his tomb.&#x201d; <br>Robbing a mummified corpse of its sarcophagus hardly constituted respect, I thought. Artemon seemed to be amused by my misgivings. <br>&#x201c;Here, Pecunius, let&#x2019;s have a look at the mummy before we remove it from the sarcophagus. They say the state of preservation is quite remarkable.&#x201d; <br>He took my arm and together we stepped onto the dais. As the lid was hoisted onto the wagon, the two of us peered over the edge of the sarcophagus. <br>So it came to pass that I, Gordianus of Rome, at the age of twenty-two, in the city of Alexandria and in the company of cutthroats and bandits, found myself face to face with the most famous mortal who ever lived. <br>For a man who had been dead over two hundred years, the conqueror&#x2019;s features were remarkably well preserved. His eyes were closed, as if he slept, but his eyelashes were perfectly intact. I could almost imagine that he might suddenly blink and gaze back at me. <br>&#x201c;Look out!&#x201d; someone shouted. <br>I turned around to see that we had company&#x2014;not royal soldiers, but a handful of regular citizens, no doubt outraged at the desecration of their city&#x2019;s most sacred monument. A few had daggers. The rest were armed only with clubs and stones. <br>As Artemon&#x2019;s men fell on the newcomers, cutting them down and driving them back, one of the angry citizens raised his arm and took aim at me. I saw the jagged rock hurtle toward me. <br>Artemon grabbed my arm and pulled me sharply to one side, but too late. I felt a sharp blow against my head. The world turned upside down as I fell from the dais onto the wagon, striking my head against one corner of the crate. Groggily, I drew back and saw blood&#x2014;my blood&#x2014;on the wood. Then everything went black. <br>How had I come to such a sorry pass? <br>Let me tell you the story. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Steven Saylor <br></p><h2>The Raven&#39;s Tail: Northern Geometric Style Weaving</h2><p>To produce this book, Cheryl Samuel travelled to Leningrad, Copenhagen, and London to examine the six robes in Europe.

BYR</h2><p>Offers the explorer&#39;s diaries and notes from his Greenland Expedition and his North Pole and transatlantic flights, along with a chronology and the 1926 navigational report</p><p>Around the turn of the 20th century, polar exploration became the symbol of national pride and individual worth. Ernest Shackleton, Robert Scott, Roald Amundsen, and Robert Peary, among others, ensured themselves a place in history for their daring assaults on two of the most inhospitable regions on earth: the North and South Poles. In the course of their explorations, these men pitted themselves against a merciless landscape--Shackleton's ship was crushed in Antarctic ice; Scott and four companions died in a howling blizzard on their way back from the South Pole. If walking to the Poles was difficult, flying there presented its own set of problems. Yet, in 1926 Admiral Richard E. Byrd and his pilot, Floyd Bennett, set out to fly over the North Pole. According to Byrd, they succeeded. In the decades since this feat, a shadow of doubt has crept over Byrd's claim. Critics question whether Byrd could have flown to the Pole and back in the amount of time that actually elapsed between his takeoff and return to Spitsbergen, Greenland; allegations that Byrd's calculations were incorrect bolstered hearsay gossip that Bennett had told another pilot that they'd never reached the Pole. <p> More than 70 years later, new evidence, in the form of a rediscovered diary of Admiral Byrd, throws fresh fuel on the flames of controversy. Raimund E. Goerler, an archivist at Ohio State University, discovered Byrd's handwritten account of the flight in 1996, but rather than laying all doubt to rest once and for all, the diary only serves to further muddy the waters. There are, for example, the suspicious erasures of calculations--innocent errors or a deliberate attempt to fudge the data? In <i>To the Pole</i>, Goerler offers up both Byrd's journal and the opinions of experts on both sides of the controversy in this evenhanded treatment of a historical puzzle.</p>This contribution to polar historya contextualized and annotated reproduction of Richard Byrd's scant diary during the most important years of his lifefrom Ohio State University archivist Goerler will likely be of interest to only the most fanatical scholars of Arctic and Antarctic exploration. During the years covered here, Byrd conducted his path-breaking expedition to Greenland, undertook the controversial North Pole flight, and made the third transatlantic flight. He kept a rather hasty diary (Byrd admits it ``is a very poor affair indeed. The most uninteresting [diary] ever written,'' and he's not far wrong). Goerler unearthed the journal while cataloging Byrd's papers. As Byrd scribbled his entries almost randomly, Goerler has gone to the trouble of deciphering their arrangement, setting them in chronological order, and adding explanatory notes. Each of the three expeditions gets a chapter, and each chapter is introduced by Goerler with a biographical sketch of Byrd at the time. Don't expect any earth-shattering discoveriesthe North Pole flight remains as controversial as ever. But readers will take away a little taste of what (supposedly) transpired between Byrd and his pilot Floyd Bennett during the flight. While the airplane's engines thundered, making conversation impossible, Byrd communicated to Bennett by writing instructions in the diary and showing them to Bennett: ``You must not persist in keeping too far to the right.'' The diary is also a reminder that not all great achievements are accompanied by nonstop thrills; the entries suggest great prairies of boredom and logisitics punctuated by flashes of intense excitement. The fact that Byrd kept the diary at all leads one to believe he had nothing to hide. Experts will pore over the sextant readings, looking for clues; most folks will dip into these pages for the brief you-were-there moments.

How exuberantly alive we should have felt to be freed, at last, from such a grim, lonely and stifling place. How pitifully delighted we should have been to be riding on a bus that rumbled slowly southward. But if we felt joy, we didn't show it. We sat, all three, pale, silent, staring out the windows, very frightened by all we saw.<br><br>Free. Was ever a word more wonderful than that one? No, even though the cold and bony hands of death would reach out and drag us back, if God wasn't up there somewhere, or maybe down here on the bus, riding with us and looking out for us. At some time in our life we had to believe in someone.<br><br>The hours passed with the miles. Our nerves grew frazzled because the bus stopped often to pick up and let off passengers. It stopped for rest breaks, for breakfast, then to pick up a single huge black lady who stood alone where a dirt road met the concrete interstate. It took her forever to pull herself onto the bus, then lug inside the many bundles she carried with her. Just as she was finally seated, we passed over the state line between Virginia and North Carolina.<br><br>Oh! The relief to be gone from that state of our imprisonment! For the first time in years, I began to relax -- a little.<br><br>We three were the youngest on the bus. Chris was seventeen years old and strikingly handsome with long, waving blond hair that just touched his shoulders, then curled upward. His darkly fringed blue eyes rivaled the color of a summer sky, and he was in personality like a warm sunny day -- he put on a brave face despite the bleakness of our situation. His straight and finely shaped nose had just taken on the strength and maturity that promised to make him all that our father had been -- the type of man to make every woman's heart flutter when he looked her way, or even when he didn't. His expression was confident; he almost looked happy. If he hadn't looked at Carrie he might have even <i>been</i> happy. But when he saw her sickly, pale face, he frowned and worry darkened his eyes. He began to pluck on the strings of the guitar strapped to his shoulder. Chris played "Oh Susannah," singing softly in a sweet melancholy voice that touched my heart. We looked at each other and felt sad with the memories the tune brought back. Like one we were, he and I. I couldn't bear to look at him for too long, for fear I would cry.<br><br>Curled up on my lap was my younger sister. She didn't look older than three, but she was eight years old and small, so pitifully small, and weak. In her large, shadowed blue eyes fingered more dark secrets and sufferings than a child her age should know. Carrie's eyes were old, very, very old. She expected nothing: no happiness, no love, nothing -- for all that had been wonderful in her life had been taken from her. Weakened by apathy, she seemed willing to pass from life into death. It hurt to see her so alone, so terribly alone now that Cory was gone.<br><br>I was fifteen. The year was 1960, and it was November. I wanted everything, needed everything, and I was so terribly afraid I'd never in an my life find enough to make up for what I had already lost. I sat tense, ready to scream if one more bad thing happened. Like a coiled fuse attached to a time bomb, I knew that sooner or later I would explode and bring down all those who lived in Foxworth Hall!<br><br>Chris laid his hand on mine, as if he could read my mind and knew I was already thinking about how I would bring hell to those who had tried to destroy us.<br><br>He said in a low voice, "Don't look like that, Cathy. It's going to be all right. We'll get by."<br><br>He was still the eternal cockeyed optimist, believing, despite everything, that whatever happened was for the best! God, how could he think so when Cory was dead? How could that possibly be for the best?<br><br>"Cathy," he whispered, "we have to make the most of what we have left, and that is each other. We have to accept what's happened and go on from there. We have to believe in ourselves, our talents, and if we do, we will get what we want. It works that way, Cathy, really it does. It has to!"<br><br>He wanted to be a dull, staid doctor who spent his days in small examination rooms, surrounded by human miseries. I wanted something far more fanciful -- and a <i>mountain</i> of it! I wanted all my star-filled dreams of love and romance to be fulfilled -- on the stage, where I'd be the world's <i>most</i> famous prima ballerina; nothing less would do! <i>That would show Momma!</i><br><br><i>Damn you, Momma! I hope Foxworth Hall burns to the ground! I hope you never sleep a comfortable night in that grand swan bed, never again! I hope your young husband finds a mistress younger and more beautiful than you! I hope he gives you the hell you deserve!</i><br><br>Carrie turned to whisper: "Cathy, I don't feel so good. My stomach, it feels funny...." I was seized by fear. Her small face seemed unnaturally pale; her hair, once so bright and shining, hung in dull, lank strings. Her voice was merely a weak whisper.<br><br>"Darling, darling." I comforted and then kissed her. "Hang on. We're taking you to a doctor soon. It won't be so long before we reach Florida and there we'll never be locked up."<br><br>Carrie slumped in my arms as I miserably stared out at the dangling Spanish moss that indicated we were now in South Carolina. We still had to pass through Georgia...It would be a long time before we arrived in Sarasota. Violently Carrie jerked upright and began to choke and retch.<br><br>I'd judiciously stuffed my pockets with paper napkins during our last rest break, so I was able to clean up Carrie. I handed her over to Chris so I could kneel on the floor to clean up the rest. Chris slid over to the window and tried to force it open to throw out the sodden paper napkins. The window refused to budge no matter how hard he pushed and shoved. Carrie began to cry.<br><br>"Put the napkins in the crevice between the seat and the side of the bus," whispered Chris, but that keeneyed bus driver must have been watching through his rear-view mirror, for he bellowed out, "You kids back there -- get rid of that stinking mess some other way!" What other way but to take everything from the outside pocket of Chris's Polaroid camera case, which I was using as a purse, and stuff the smelly napkins in there.<br><br>"I'm sorry," sobbed Carrie as she clung desperately to Chris. "I didn't mean to do it. Will they put us in jail now?"<br><br>"No, of course not," said Chris in his fatherly way. "In less than two hours we'll be in Florida. Just try to hang on until then. If we get off now we'll lose the money we've paid for our tickets, and we don't have much money to waste."<br><br>Carrie began to whimper and tremble. I felt her forehead and it was clammy, and now her face wasn't just pale, but white! Like Cory's before he had died.<br><br>I prayed that just once God would have some mercy on us. Hadn't we endured enough? Did it have to go on and on? While I hesitated with the squeamish desire to vomit myself, Carrie let go again. I couldn't believe she had anything left. I sagged against Chris while Carrie went limp in his arms and looked heartbreakingly near unconsciousness. "I think she's going into shock," whispered Chris, his face almost as pale as Carrie's.<br><br>This was when a mean, heartless passenger really began to complain, and loudly, so the compassionate ones looked embarrassed and undecided as to what to do to help us. Chris's eyes met mine. He asked a mute question -- what were we to do next?<br><br>I was beginning to panic. Then, down the aisle, swaying from side to side as she advanced toward us, came that huge black woman smiling at us reassuringly. She had paper bags with her which she held for me to drop the smelly napkins in. With gestures but no words she patted my shoulder, chucked Carrie under the chin and then handed me a handful of rags taken from one of her bundles. "Thank you," I whispered, and smiled weakly as I did a better job of cleaning myself, Carrie and Chris. She took the rags and stuffed them in the bag, then stood back as if to protect us.<br><br>Full of gratitude, I smiled at the very, very fat woman who filled the aisle with her brilliantly gowned body. She winked, then smiled back.<br><br>"Cathy," said Chris, his expression more worried than before, "we've, got to get Carrie to a doctor, and soon!"<br><br>"But we've paid our way to Sarasota!"<br><br>"I know, but this is an emergency."<br><br>Our benefactor smiled reassuringly, then she leaned over to peer into Carrie's face. She put her large black hand to Carrie's clammy brow, then put her fingers to her pulse. She made some gestures with her hands which puzzled me, but Chris said, "She must not be able to talk, Cathy. Those are the signs deaf people make." I shrugged to tell her we didn't understand her signs. She frowned, then whipped from a dress pocket beneath a heavy red sweater she wore a pad of multicolored sheets of notepaper and very swiftly she wrote a note which she handed to me.<br><br><i>My name Henrietta Beech, she'd written, Can hear, but no talk. Little girl is very, very sick and need good doctor.</i> I read this, then looked at her hoping she'd have more information. "Do you know of a good doctor?" I asked. She nodded vigorously, then quickly dashed off another green note. <i>Your good fortune I be on your bus, and can take you to my own doctor-son who is very best doctor.</i><br><br>"Good golly," murmured Chris when I handed him the note, "we sure must be under a lucky star to have someone to direct us to such a doctor."<br><br>"Look here, driver," yelled the meanest man on the bus. "Get that sick kid to a hospital! Damned if I paid my good money to ride on a stinking bus!"<br><br>The other passengers looked at him with disapproval, and I could see in the rear-view mirror that the driver's face flushed with anger, or perhaps it was humiliation. In the mirror our eyes met. He lamely called to me. "I'm sorry but I've got a wife and five kids and if I don't keep my schedules, then my wife and kids won't eat, because I'll be out of a job." Mutely I pleaded with my eyes, making him mumble to himself, "Damn Sundays. Let the week days go by just fine, then comes Sunday, damn Sundays."<br><br>This was when Henrietta Beech seemed to have heard enough. Again she picked up her pencil and notepad and wrote. This note she showed to me.<br><br><i>Okay, man in driver's seat who hates Sundays. Keep on ignoring little sick girl, and her parents will sue big shot bus owners for two million!</i><br><br>No sooner had Chris had the chance to skim this note than she was waddling up the aisle and she pushed the note into the driver's face. Impatiently he shoved it away, but she thrust it forward again, and this time he made an attempt to read it while keeping one eye on the traffic.<br><br>"Oh, God," sighed the driver whose face I could clearly see in the mirror. "The nearest hospital is twenty miles off my route."<br><br>Both Chris and I watched, fascinated, as the mammoth black lady made gestures and signals that left the driver as frustrated as we had been. Once again she had to write a note, and whatever she wrote in that one soon had him turning the bus off the wide highway onto a side road that led into a city named Clairmont. Henrietta Beech stayed with the driver, obviously giving him instructions, but she took the time to look back at us and shine on us a brilliant smile, assuring us that everything would be just fine.<br><br>Soon we were rolling along quiet, wide streets with trees that arched gracefully overhead. The houses I stared at were large, aristocratic, with verandas and towering cupolas. Though in the mountains of Virginia it had already snowed once or twice, autumn had not yet laid a frosty hand here. The maples, beeches, oaks and magnolias still held most of their summer leaves, and a few flowers still bloomed.<br><br>The bus driver didn't think Henrietta Beech was directing him right, and to be honest I didn't think she was either. Really, they didn't put medical buildings on this kind of residential street. But just as I was beginning to get worried, the bus jerked to a sudden halt in front of a big white house perched on a low, gentle hill and surrounded by spacious lawns and flower beds.<br><br>"You kids!" the bus driver bellowed back to us, "pack your gear, turn in your tickets for a refund, or use them before the time limit expires!" Then quickly he was out of the bus and opening up the locked underbelly, and from there he pulled out forty or so suitcases before he came to our two. I slung Cory's guitar and banjo over my shoulders, as Chris very gently, and with a great deal of tenderness, lifted Carrie in his arms.<br><br>Like a fat mother hen, Henrietta Beech hustled us up the long brick walk to the front veranda and there I hesitated, staring at the house, the double black doors. To the right a small sign read FOR PATIENTS ONLY. This was obviously a doctor who had offices in his own home. Our two suitcases were left back in the shade near the concrete sidewalk while I scanned the veranda to spy a man sleeping in a white wicker chair. Our good Samaritan approached him with a wide smile before she gently touched him on the arm, and when he still slept on she gestured for us to advance and speak for ourselves. Next she pointed to the house, and made signals to indicate she had to get inside and prepare a meal for us to eat.<br><br>I wished she'd stayed to introduce us, to explain why we were on his porch on Sunday. Even as Chris and I stole on cautious pussywillow feet toward him, even as I filled with fear I was sniffing the air filled with the scent of roses and feeling that I'd been here before and knew this place. This fresh air perfumed with roses was not the kind of air I'd grown to expect as the kind deemed worthy for such as me. "It's Sunday, damn Sunday," I whispered to Chris, "and that doctor may not appreciate our being here."<br><br>"He's a doctor," said Chris, "and he's used to having his spare time robbed...but <i>you</i> can wake him up."<br><br>Slowly I approached. He was a large man wearing a pale gray suit with a white carnation in his buttonhole. His long legs were stretched out and lifted to the top of the balustrade. He looked rather elegant, even sprawled out as he was with his hands dangling over the arms of the chair. He appeared so comfortable it seemed a terrible pity to awaken him and put him back on duty.<br><br>"Are you Dr. Paul Sheffield?" asked Chris who had read the sign with the doctor's name. Carrie lay in his arms with her neck arched backwards, her eyes closed and her long golden hair waving in the soft, warm breezes. Reluctantly the doctor came awake. He stared at us long moments, as if disbelieving his eyes. I knew we looked strange in our many layers of clothing. He shook his head as if trying to focus his eyes, and such beautiful hazel eyes they were, bejeweled with flecks of blue, green and gold on soft brown. Those remarkable eyes drank me in, then swallowed me down. He appeared dazzled, slightly drunk, and much too sleepy to put on his customary professional mask that would keep him from darting his eyes from my face to my breasts, then to my legs before he scanned slowly upward. And again he was hypnotized by my face, my hair. It was hair that was far too long, I knew that, and it was clumsily cut on top, and too pale and fragile on the ends.<br><br>"You are the doctor, aren't you?" demanded Chris.<br><br>"Yes, of course. I'm Dr. Sheffield," he finally said, now turning his attention to Chris and Carrie. Surprisingly graceful and quick, he lifted his legs from the railing, rose to his feet to tower above us, ran long fingers through the mop of his dark hair, and then stepped closer to peer down into Carrie's small, white face. He pa...</p><h2>Hebrew for the Goyim</h2><p>Each letter of the Hebrew alphabet was first a picture with a purpose, a drawing with meaning. Yes, there are codes in the Bible.

They have rescued hostages in various types of buildings and have dealt with barricaded bank robbers, prison rioters, and assorted dangerous criminals. Thousands have been rescued and millions have been safer because terrorists were aware that elite antiterrorist units were poised to take action should they take hostages. <br><br>Following the September 11th attack on the World Trade Centre, the mission of many anti-terrorist units has expanded. Some units now track terrorists to their lairs in other countries and strike them there. Despite the significant and growing role of these units, little is known about the way they operate. The selection, training, structure and principles of maintaining such units, together with basic theories of asymmetric warfare are the subject of Thompson's latest work. <br><br>In a practical, step-by-step guide he analyses the necessary organization of such elite teams, the arming and equipping of units, and methods for a variety of missions from hostage rescue and high-level dignitary protection to securing foreign embassies and counter-WMD strikes.<br><br>Open the pages of this book and enter the world of the counter-terrorist operator.</p><p>Leroy Thompson is one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on special army and police units.

From the age of ten, I grew up in a religious home; my grandfather was an evangelist and my parents joined his church too. Before then, though, we lived in East Detroit and worshiped baseball. I was the happiest kid in the world.<br><br>The Furniers were Huguenots, part French-Canadian people who came over to the New World with the French Protestants in the seventeenth century. They eventually married into some Sioux Indians and a lot of Irish. As a result, two out of three parts of my ethnic background are very alcohol prone. My seventh cousin was the Marquis de Lafayette, the same Lafayette who secured the support of the French during the American Revolution and fought alongside George Washington at Valley Forge. Look at a portrait of Lafayette and you&#x2019;ll notice the same high cheekbones and long black hair as me. Some say I look just like him, especially when I&#x2019;m on stage with my sword. I can feel my bloodlines, since swashbuckling comes naturally to me&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the French part of me, I guess.<br><br>My grandfather, Thurman Sylvester Furnier, was the president of what was called the Church of Jesus Christ. It wasn&#x2019;t the Church of Latter- day Saints&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t a Mormon church. In fact, their biggest religious rivals were the Mormons. If you called one of his church members a Mormon, that was like stabbing them in the heart.<br><br>My mother was born Ella McCartt in Glenmary, Tennessee. You can&#x2019;t find Glenmary on a map. It was a whistle-stop. Her mother died when she was very young. She has childhood memories of putting clear liquid into Ball jars for her dad, who was a moonshiner in Glenmary. She had six brothers and sisters, and all of them helped out with the &#x201c;family business&#x201d;&#x2014;and meanwhile the old man kept about forty or fifty thousand dollars in cash buried in the yard. This was in 1946, and at that time, fifty grand was equivalent to about half a million dollars. My grandfather didn&#x2019;t trust banks.<br><br>At age sixteen, around the end of World War II, my mother ran away from home and found her way up to Detroit to work in the factories. That&#x2019;s where she met my dad, whom people called Mick, though his real name was Ether Maroni Furnier (another Mormon-sounding name). He had just been discharged from the Navy. They were soon married.<br><br>I was born in Detroit on February 4, 1948. My first memory of growing up in working-class East Detroit is sitting in a smoke-filled living room with my dad and his brothers, watching Friday-night boxing. There was lots of Carling&#x2019;s Black Label beer and Lucky Strike cigarettes; I would drink Vernor&#x2019;s ginger ale. There was always so much smoke in the room, I&#x2019;m surprised I didn&#x2019;t contract lung cancer. All the girls stayed in the other room while I sat with the men, my uncles and their buddies, watching the fights on a tiny black-and- white TV set.<br><br>Growing up in Detroit was great. I loved my life because my dad and my uncles were so cool. I was the only boy in our family. There was me (Vince) and my sister Nickie, then thirteen cousins, mostly girls. I was the only male left to carry on the Furnier name. So, of course, I ended up legally changing my name to Alice Cooper.<br><br>My uncles were Damon Runyon&#x2013;type characters&#x2014;tough guys with colorful speech and fascinating stories. Uncle Jocko ran a crooked pool hall in East Detroit. He was my dad&#x2019;s oldest brother, a spry lightweight prizefighter with a broken nose and not an ounce of fat on him. We all called him Jocko, but his real name was Vincent Collier Furnier. I was named after him. If you wanted to buy anything hot, you went to Jocko&#x2019;s pool hall. Or if Fast Eddie Felson came in to play Minnesota Fats, that happened at Jocko&#x2019;s too. It was a famous Detroit dump. During a hot game, the doors would close and lock for hours, sometimes days. My uncle would bring in food and drinks and host the game in exchange for a small cut of the winnings.<br><br>Jocko was a swell guy. He used to come over and poke me in the ribs, saying, &#x201c;Watch that right hook!&#x201d;<br><br>My uncle Lefty, whose real name was Lonson Thurman Furnier, was a whole different deal. He was what you would refer to as a playboy. I never saw Uncle Lefty without a tuxedo, his shirt half-buttoned. He had left Detroit and moved west to Los Angeles, and he worked for Jet Propulsion Labs there. He was the guy who wined and dined the company&#x2019;s biggest accounts, which is why he was always dressed to the nines. He was part James Bond, part wheeler-dealer&#x2014;a total Rat Pack&#x2013; type guy. He would have fit in well with Sinatra and Martin. In fact, he actually hung out with Lana Turner and Ava Gardner, some of the same girls the Rat Pack dated (without my aunt knowing about it, of course).<br><br>The great industrial car town of Detroit has always been your classic sports city. The Red Wings were unbeatable. The Pistons were great. Even the Detroit Lions were a really good team at one time. But the Tigers were a religion in our household. They had Ty Cobb, the greatest player of all time, on their team, plus Al Kaline, Mickey Cochrane, Hank Greenberg, and Denny McLain. These were legendary players playing on mythical teams. It was all my dad and I talked about: &#x201c;What did the Tigers do last night?&#x201d; I was transfixed with Ernie Harwell&#x2019;s colorful play-by-play commentary on the radio.<br><br>I lived for baseball. When the sun came up, I grabbed my glove and I was ready to play until the sun went down, when you couldn&#x2019;t see the ball anymore and it was time to rush home for dinner.<br><br>East Detroit was a real American melting pot. Each street had their crew&#x2014;not so much gangs, but characters who banded together as teams. One street over might be all-Italian, while the street after that could be all-black. And next to the blacks were the Irish. Lincoln Street, where I grew up, was principally Polish. People&#x2019;s names ended in &#x201c;ski.&#x201d; Kowalski, Jankowski, Adamski . . . Furnier. We were practically the only non-Polish family on Lincoln. So we were the Polish team. Mornings during baseball season, someone would invariably ask, &#x201c;Who are we playing today?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re playing the Irish.&#x201d;<br><br>So we&#x2019;d walk over to Corktown, the old Irish district. The Irish were cool enough guys. The next day, we&#x2019;d play the Italians. Hopefully, Bruno wasn&#x2019;t pitching, because that guy threw hard. We all knew each other, and there weren&#x2019;t any ethnic or racial problems. Every day a different team, every day a different ethnic nationality. Sandlot rules. No grass. A brand-new baseball was just unheard of. Our baseball had a great big flap coming out of it until it was eventually taped up. Then we batted around a ball wrapped tight in black electrician&#x2019;s tape. We did whatever we could do, just to play.<br><br>I went on to become a pretty good baseball player. One of my best skills was hand-to-eye coordination. I could put the bat on the ball inside or outside the strike zone. If somebody threw a pitch two feet out of the strike zone, low and outside, I could put my bat out and hit it. And I had good rhythm.<br><br>My room was a shrine to the Detroit Tigers. No posters, just pictures. A dozen shoe boxes stuffed with baseball cards, cards from packages bought for a nickel apiece, that came with flat squares of bubble gum that congealed into one giant gum brick. I&#x2019;m sure I had a Mickey Mantle rookie card stashed in there somewhere, along with other cards that could have been worth hundreds or thousands of dollars today if my mother hadn&#x2019;t thrown them out after I left home. That&#x2019;s where my allowance went. We traded our cards and flipped doubles. Played tops. When I wasn&#x2019;t playing baseball or trading cards, I was lying on my bed in my room memorizing batting averages and ERAs. Music wasn&#x2019;t such a big deal to me. Elvis was out there, and yeah he was cool, but I was addicted to baseball.<br><br>On my seventh birthday, my dad got us tickets to a Tigers game at Briggs Stadium. It would be the first time I had seen my heroes play in person. With the game still two months away, I couldn&#x2019;t sleep. I was a basket case. I was going to see Al Kaline, Harvey Kuenn, Charlie Maxwell, Rocky Colavito, and Jim Bunning.<br><br>I remember it distinctly. It was the Tigers vs. the Cleveland Indians, a doubleheader. I remember walking up the ramp of Briggs Stadium and the smell of freshly mowed grass and hot dogs. I remember hearing the cracking sound of batting practice, the sock of a baseball soaring into the outfield. I sat there dumbfounded throughout both games, not moving. I didn&#x2019;t want a Coke. I didn&#x2019;t want a hot dog. I didn&#x2019;t ask for anything. I was afraid if I moved, it was all going to be over. Jim Bunning vs. Herb Score. Charlie Maxwell hit four home runs in two games. We won 7&#x2013;0 and 8&#x2013;2 and swept the doubleheader. I went home that night exhausted but in heaven. It was the best day I could ever have imagined. If someone had offered me a choice, Disneyland or a Tigers doubleheader, it would have been a no-brainer: Tigers all the way. To this day, when ESPN flashes MLB scores, I still check to see whether the Tigers won or lost. The Tigers run deep in my psyche.<br><br>In our family, there were three basic rules:<br><br>1.

One is legendary - a Donegal house where children are stolen away by demonic forces; the other is actual - the city of Derry in the Northern Ireland of the 1940s and 1950s, a place haunted by political enmities and family secrets.</p><p>The Derry of poet Seamus Deane's first novel, <i>Reading in the Dark</i> is a perilous place. Ghosts haunt the stairwells of apartment buildings, a curse follows two families down through the generations, close friends turn out to be police informers, and the police are as likely to persecute an innocent man as protect him. And hovering over all the violence, poverty, and despair of 1940s Northern Ireland is the specter of the "Troubles." The hero of the novel is an unnamed young man whose life turns upside down when a policeman frames him. Deception becomes his only means of self-defense. But the initial lie on the part of the policeman and the narrator's corresponding trickery are only part of the tangled web Deane weaves here. Early in the novel we learn that Uncle Eddie, an Irish Republican Army gunman, was blown up in the town distillery in 1922. In addition to sorting out his own problems, the narrator seeks the truth about his uncle's death. <p> <i>Reading in the Dark</i> sounds grim, and in some respects it is, yet leavening is provided by infusions of the Irish folktales and legends that inform the characters' daily life. And then there is the language. Deane is a poet, and his prose shows it: sex is like fire, "glinting with greed and danger"; ice snores and candles are swathed in a "thick drapery of wax." Readers looking for a thoughtful, serious, and beautifully written novel will find one in <i>Reading in the Dark.</i></p>A New York Times Notable Book<br>Winner of the Guardian Fiction Prize<br>Winner of the Irish Times Fiction Award and International Award <br>"A swift and masterful transformation of family griefs and political violence into something at once rhapsodic and heartbreaking. If Issac Babel had been born in Derry, he might have written this sudden, brilliant book."<br>--Seamus Heaney <br>Hugely acclaimed in Great Britain, where it was awarded the Guardian Fiction Prize and short-listed for the Booker, Seamus Deane's first novel is a mesmerizing story of childhood set against the violence of Northern Ireland in the 1940s and 1950s. <br>The boy narrator grows up haunted by a truth he both wants and does not want to discover. The matter: a deadly betrayal, unspoken and unspeakable, born of political enmity. As the boy listens through the silence that surrounds him, the truth spreads like a stain until it engulfs him and his family. And as he listens, and watches, the world of legend--the stone fort of Grianan, home of the warrior Fianna; the Field of the Disappeared, over which no gulls fly--reveals its transfixing reality. Meanwhile the real world of adulthood unfolds its secrets like a collection of folktales: the dead sister walking again; the lost uncle, Eddie, present on every page; the family house "as cunning and articulate as a labyrinth, closely designed, with someone sobbing at the heart of it." <br>Seamus Deane has created a luminous tale about how childhood fear turns into fantasy and fantasy turns into fact. Breathtakingly sad but vibrant and unforgettable, Reading in the Dark is one of the finest books about growing up--in Ireland or anywhere--that has ever been written.</p><h2>Harley &amp; Ivy Meet Betty &amp; Veronica</h2><p><b>The bad girls of Gotham meet the good girls of Riverdale!<br><br>Hiram Lodge (Veronica's father) wants to invest in the future by building a university with free tuition for Riverdale's residents.

Taking in 440 sextillion kilometres of space and 13.8 billion years of time, it is physically impossible to make a better map: we will never see the early universe in more detail. On the one hand, such a view is the apotheosis of modern cosmology, on the other, it threatens to undermine almost everything we hold cosmologically sacrosanct.&nbsp; <p>The map contains anomalies that challenge our understanding of the universe. It will force us to revisit what is known and what is unknown, to construct a new model of our universe. This is the first book to address what will be an epoch-defining scientific paradigm shift. Stuart Clark will ask if Newton's famous laws of gravity need to be rewritten; if dark matter and dark energy are just celestial phantoms? Can we ever know what happened before the Big Bang? What&#x2019;s at the bottom of a black hole? Are there universes beyond our own? Does time exist? Are the once immutable laws of physics changing?</p></p><p>Stuart Clark, Ph.D., is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and is the astrology correspondent for&nbsp;The New Scientist.&nbsp;Stuart holds a first-class honors degree and a Ph.D. in astrophysics.&nbsp;The Sun Kings,&nbsp;which established him as a popular science writer of the highest level, was shortlisted for the Royal Society science book prize and won the Association of American Publishers 2007 Professional and Scholarly Publishing Award for Excellence in the Cosmology and Astronomy category. Stuart lives in England.&#x201c;The author brings the subject up to 2015 with the obligatory new discovery combined with a fine history of cosmology, and he makes it clear that our knowledge and ignorance seem to be expanding in parallel. Since satisfying results have yet to turn up, Clark's book ends on a cliffhanger, but readers will be entirely pleased with the experience.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Herein lies the tale of intrepid astronomers, across time and cultures, who were the first to observe, identify, and document our misbehaving Sun.

In constant pain through heart problems, broken bones and the aftermath of a second bout of drug addiction, his career wasn't in much better shape than his body. One of his last singles for CBS, before they dumped him in 1986 after nearly 30 years, had been 'Chicken In Black'. At the age of 60, all the signs were that Cash was ready for the museum. In fact, he was building one. Already an exhibit in the Country Music Hall of Fame, when he wasn't playing small, shabby venues like Roadie's Roadhouse, Mississauga, Ontario or Butlins Southcoast World in Bognor Regis, he was preparing to open the Cash Country theme park in Branson, Missouri. Cut to a little under two years later. December 1993. Cash is playing the Viper Room on Sunset Boulevard in front of 150 of the hippest people in America. He is introduced by Johnny Depp; the audience includes Sean Penn, Juliette Lewis and assorted Red Hot Chili Peppers. They cheer him to the rafters for the full ninety minutes. He has just completed recording his landmark American Recordings, made with Midas-like hip-hop and metal producer Rick Rubin. He won a Grammy for that record and a fistful more for his five other American Recordings albums. He played an unforgettable Glastonbury set in 1994 and was feted by one and all, from Nick Cave and Bono to Trent Reznor. From thereon until his death in 2003 (and beyond), Cash was, once again, the epitome of hip. Big Daddy cool. <i>The Resurrection Of Johnny Cash</i> tells the story of perhaps the most remarkable turnaround in musical history. As well as acknowledging Cash's drug, drink and religious travails in the fifties and sixties, the book digs much deeper, focusing on a lesser known but no less remarkable period of his life: the inglorious fall post-1970 and the almost biblical rebirth in his later years.</p></p><p>Graeme Thomson is the author of three acclaimed biographies of elusive, often difficult musicians: Complicated Shadows (Canongate, 2004), a study of Elvis Costello; The Outlaw (Virgin, 2006), an intimate portrait of Willie Nelson; and most recently Under The Ivy (Omnibus, 2010), an in-depth biography of Kate Bush.

"She doesn't have parents./No one knows her name./But the people in town/Call her Wee Sister Strange." Grant's Edgar Allan Poe-ish tale is balanced by Campbell's soft illustrations in watercolor and colored pencil, which depict a fey redheaded sprite with huge hazel eyes, pert coral lips, and a ratty yellow dress, who prances through the night searching delicately for a bedtime story. The settings shift from an autumnal forest with prowling wolves and barn owls to a deep bog filled with axolotls.

Many of her customers were single, eligible men who her parents would have been thrilled to meet.<br> <br>It was all good. All things she knew she should be happy about. Her parents were proud of her, too. Not only was she living on her own and supporting herself, but they were also sure she was eventually going to bring home a nice man who was a lot like them, i.e., wealthy and good-mannered. Then, in no time, she would settle down, get married, have her two children, and eventually raise her own homecoming queen.<br> <br>Though all of that hadn&#x2019;t been exactly her goals in life, Marie knew it was a possibility. Maybe she would have done all that, too, if she hadn&#x2019;t begun to realize that everything she had wasn&#x2019;t actually everything she&#x2019;d ever wanted.<br> <br>After Andy died, she&#x2019;d decided to stop contemplating change and actually make one.<br> <br>Three months ago, when John B. had asked them all to make a promise to reconnect, she had agreed immediately, knowing that both her heart and her soul needed these friends of hers. Needed them more than a fancy future or even making her mother&#x2019;s dreams a reality.<br> <br>And then, of course, there was John B.<br> <br>After living most of her life in his periphery, wanting to be more than just his friend, but feeling sure that he would never want the same thing, she&#x2019;d decided to give things between them one more try.<br> <br>It might be a pipe dream. John might never look beyond their differences or want to put her in front of his family&#x2019;s wishes. But Marie knew that if she didn&#x2019;t finally make her desire known to him, to simply lay it all out there and hope for the best, she would always regret it.<br> <br>Treating her to the intense look Marie was oh so familiar with, Mom said, &#x201c;Are you ready to tell me the truth about why you moved back to Walnut Creek?&#x201d; She suddenly frowned. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t having bad dreams again, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mother was referring to the same reoccurring dream she&#x2019;d had since childhood. She used to wake her parents up at least once a week with her cries. &#x201c;Some, but they haven&#x2019;t been too bad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure? I bet I could call around and see if Miss Flemming is still in practice.&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss Flemming had been her therapist for two years back when she&#x2019;d been in middle school. She was a nice lady, but she&#x2019;d been old even then. &#x201c;I hope she&#x2019;s still not practicing, Mom. I saw her years ago. She needs to be sitting on a beach somewhere instead of listening to everyone else&#x2019;s problems, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; she joked.<br> <br>Her mother didn&#x2019;t crack a smile. &#x201c;She helped you learn to relax, Marie.&#x201d;<br> <br>No, Miss Flemming had helped her learn how to cope when things happened that were out of her control. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been doing my breathing exercises. I&#x2019;ll get better. It&#x2019;s just been a really difficult time, Mom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know. I still worry about you. Dad and I love you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know. And I love you, too. That&#x2019;s one of the reasons I&#x2019;m glad I&#x2019;ll be here in Walnut Creek. It will be nice to see you both more often. I also have a really good group of friends here. I want to live near them. The rest of the Eight feel the same way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mother&#x2019;s expression softened. &#x201c;They were good friends to you. Good kids, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re all adults now, Mom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know that. It&#x2019;s just that when I think of the Eight, I can&#x2019;t help but remember the way you all would run around together.&#x201d; Her lips twitched. &#x201c;My goodness. You all were so loud! Always laughing. Always in a hurry. Dad used to call you guys a pack of hounds. Practically inseparable.&#x201d;<br> <br>That comment should&#x2019;ve made her feel better. Instead, it only served to remind her that they&#x2019;d drifted apart . . . and they&#x2019;d suffered for it, too. Especially Andy.<br> <br>Not wanting to start crying again, she cleared her throat. &#x201c;See? Relationships like that don&#x2019;t come along more than once in a lifetime. They need to be nurtured, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dear, you&#x2019;re only twenty-four. You&#x2019;ve got years and years to make more really good friends.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I made new friends in college and in Chagrin Falls, but they weren&#x2019;t the same as the Eight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Marie . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Hating that her mother was likely to launch into a well-meaning but misguided lecture, Marie hardened her voice. &#x201c;Mom, I don&#x2019;t want to make more new, good friends. I want to work on keeping the ones that I have.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mother&#x2019;s expression softened. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not saying that you shouldn&#x2019;t all still be friends, Marie. It&#x2019;s just that sometimes you have to accept the fact that people change and they choose their own path. Just because they were a part of your childhood doesn&#x2019;t mean they need to be a part of the rest of your life.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before she could interrupt, her mother continued. &#x201c;Then, too, there&#x2019;s the fact that while you might be grown up, none of you have married yet. Things change when you get married.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know that.&#x201d;<br> <br>A pair of lines formed in between her mother&#x2019;s brows. &#x201c;Then there&#x2019;s the fact that some of you simply don&#x2019;t have anything in common anymore. You&#x2019;ve each gone down your own paths.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We do, though. We talked a lot at Andy&#x2019;s funeral.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her voice gentled. &#x201c;Marie, I&#x2019;m very sorry about Andy. He was a wonderful person. I know you&#x2019;re heartbroken about his death. Dad and I have been keeping his parents and Tricia in our prayers. But I&#x2019;m also talking about how some of those ah, adults, now live a completely different lifestyle from you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because some of the Eight are Amish?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, yes.&#x201d; Her gaze hardened. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t go acting like it doesn&#x2019;t matter. It does. If your Amish friends haven&#x2019;t been baptized yet, they soon will be. Then their paths will be set. I know it&#x2019;s hard, but it&#x2019;s a fact of life. Sometimes childhood friendships are best left as good memories.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shook her head. &#x201c;Mom, as much as it makes me feel like I&#x2019;m sixteen again, I&#x2019;m going to have to tell you that you don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mom chuckled. &#x201c;I actually do recall you telling me that a time or two, back in the day.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And, at the risk of repeating what I used to tell you, I&#x2019;m going to have to say that I might understand more than you think.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I love you, Mom.&#x201d; She reached out and gently squeezed her mother&#x2019;s hand, hoping the words and the gesture would ease her obstinate tone.<br> <br>After giving her a squeeze back, her mother dropped her hand. &#x201c;I love you, too, Marie. And unlike when you were sixteen, you&#x2019;re a grown woman now. I&#x2019;ll try to keep my opinions to a minimum.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Seeming to come to grips with herself, her mother said, &#x201c;All right then. I told your father I wouldn&#x2019;t be home until close to seven. That means we&#x2019;ve got all afternoon to turn this place into a little home for you. What do you want to do first?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can we work on my living room? I think I need something to store things in. And maybe a new lamp.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw some cute shelving units we can put together over at the Walmart in Millersburg. Want to head over there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Before her mother reached for her purse, Marie flung her arms around her. &#x201c;Thanks, Mom.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mom wrapped her arms around her, too. &#x201c;For what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For not arguing with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>After pressing her lips to her brow, her mother started chuckling. &#x201c;You might know the Eight the best, but I know you pretty well, too. And you always were as stubborn as all get out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Thinking that her stubbornness might finally get John B. to notice her, Marie smiled. After all, that was what she was counting on.</p><h2>Queen of the Wits: A Life of Laetitia Pilkington</h2><p>Poetess, fallen woman and wit, Laetitia Pilkington spent her life as close to fame as she was near to ruin.

Sent to pose as a junior lecturer at a private college in Cambridge, she will monitor any activities &#x201c;not in the interests of His Majesty&#x2019;s government.&#x201d; When the college&#x2019;s pacifist founder is murdered, Maisie finds herself in the midst of sinister web of murder, scandal, and conspiracy, activities that point towards members of the ascendant <em>Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei</em>&#x2014;the Nazi Party&#x2014;on Britain&#x2019;s shores. An instant classic, and sure to captivate long-time Maisie Dobbs fans as well as readers of Agatha Christie, Elizabeth George, and Alexander McCall Smith, <em>A Lesson in Secrets </em>is &#x201c;a powerful and complex novel, one that will linger in memory as a testament to her talent and her humanity&#x201d; (<em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em>).</p><p><br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: Lee Child Interviews Jacqueline Winspear </strong> <br> <br> Jacqueline Winspear, like her interviewer, the iconic, bestselling author Lee Child, originally hails from the United Kingdom. <em>A Lesson in Secrets</em> is her eighth novel featuring psychologist-investigator and former WW1 nurse, Maisie Dobbs. Here she talks with Child about her work on the series, and her enduring interest in the aftermath of WW1. <p></p> <strong> </strong> <strong> </strong> <p></p> <p><strong> Lee Child:</strong> People are often surprised that I'm a huge Maisie Dobbs fan, because Jack Reacher is all about a kind of Spartan American masculinity, and Maisie Dobbs is all about a kind of feminine English refinement. But they're both strong, unconventional people. Perhaps that's the cross-genre appeal? Do you find that Maisie attracts an unusual mix of readers?</p> <p><strong>Jacqueline Winspear:</strong> I&#x2019;m thrilled you&#x2019;re such a Maisie Dobbs fan--and you can count me among those millions of Jack Reacher fans. Maisie and Reacher are both unconventional, but I believe another factor in their cross-genre appeal is that both have endured life-changing challenges. Maisie attracts diverse readers: men and women, all age groups, veterans, nurses, college students, people who have faced troubles, and people interested in the era.</p> <p><strong> LC:</strong> And in fact your novels are driven by violence far worse than mine--off the page, granted, but there&#x2019;s no getting around the fact that at the heart of your books is the aftermath of a horrendous war, with its attendant violence and death. How do you see the role of violence in your novels?</p> <p><strong> JW:</strong> I think you hit the theme there with &#x201c;aftermath.&#x201d; The violence in my books is that searing, painful residue left by the passing of a terrible time, when people were also crushed emotionally by the deep losses over a four-year period. In addition, there&#x2019;s that element of violence that lingers--in <em>Among the Mad</em>, for example--when war&#x2019;s tentacles will not let go. We see that again today in the stories of veterans who are still fighting their wars, but the conflict is raging inside them.</p> <p><strong> LC:</strong> As a kid in England I remember seeing hundreds of maimed old men, and hundreds of lonely old women. My grandfather was an example of the first, and two great-aunts examples of the second - sad reminders of a terrible time. Was it something similar that drew you to the First World War and the &#x201c;Between the Wars&#x201d; era that followed?</p> <p><strong> JW:</strong> I have the same memories--my grandfather was wounded at the Battle of the Somme, and my grandmother was partially blinded at the Woolwich Arsenal, in an explosion that wounded her sister and killed several girls working alongside her. There were the elderly spinsters in my neighborhood, and for each there was that old sepia photograph on the mantelpiece, of a sweetheart or brother lost to war. Those childhood memories led me to think a lot about what happens after war is done. As a character says in <em>Birds of a Feather</em>, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the trouble with war; it lives on inside the living.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong> LC:</strong> I was introduced to Maisie Dobbs by my wife, who passed through an airport and picked up the first in the series. She loved it, and urged me to read it, and I'm glad I did. It's one of the very, very few series we both love equally--in fact, perhaps the only one. Is this typical of your readers?</p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> I receive so many emails from fans who tell me that the books are read by all members of the family. And many women tell me that it was their husband who first discovered Maisie. The books are as accessible to readers aged about fourteen as they are to seniors. There are few things today that all age groups within a family can engage in, discuss and get excited about, so it&#x2019;s lovely when I hear that family members are awaiting the next book so they can all read it.</p> <p><strong> LC:</strong> Maisie is definitively feminine, but she's running a business, and poking around in a "man's world," which is true to the times, and indicative of the early stages of feminism in the West. Was that something you wanted to explore?</p> <p><strong> JW:</strong> It would have been difficult to introduce a character such as Maisie and not explore the fact that the Great War left so many women to forge a life alone. If there was one thing I wanted to do, it was to bring the spirit of that generation to the character of Maisie Dobbs. Of course, some women floundered and lived lonely lives, but there were a great many who blazed a trail. I believe an archetype was born at that time--the stoic British woman who is independent and more than a little opinionated, with a heart of gold under a tough exterior, and who knows what it is to endure. Dame Maggie Smith has played that character in several films.</p> <p><strong> LC:</strong> Maisie understands human psychology in a way that seems to be an early and experimental pre-echo of what we'd now call criminal profiling. It's a huge part of both her process and her appeal. Where did that come from?</p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> That developed in a very organic way. Having established her as a &#x201c;sensitive,&#x201d; I wanted to give her real expertise--and there are historical underpinnings to this aspect of her character. Maisie studied the Moral Sciences curriculum at Girton College when psychology was in its infancy. I have the prospectus from 1913, and about one third of the course was the study of modern psychology. It was a time of great experimentation, so Maisie&#x2019;s processes have their roots in real practices considered innovative at the time.</p> <p><strong> LC:</strong> One of your decisions I admire is the way you have moved the series forward in time so firmly. Most writers would have continued mining the same immediate post-war seam forever. What was your thinking behind that? And how do you keep the character fresh as the series itself develops?</p> <p><strong> JW:</strong> I once heard you say at a conference, &#x201c;The reader comes back to a series, not to find out what the sleuth does with the case, but what the case does to the sleuth.&#x201d; I agree. We are all impacted not only by our past, but by our current circumstances and those around us. You always put Reacher in a new area, be it small town or big city; and through his wandering we learn a lot about him. I work with the geography of time. Not everyone likes change and many readers would like Maisie Dobbs to stay as she is in a given book. But life&#x2019;s not like that--the goalposts tend to move when we are at our most comfortable, and I want to keep the series fresh.</p> <p><strong> LC:</strong> I&#x2019;m often asked if I have a favorite book within my series, so now I&#x2019;m turning the tables: Do you have favorites among your novels?</p> <p><strong>JW:</strong> That&#x2019;s such a difficult question, because each book not only represents a different place on my journey as a writer, but has been inspired by something that touched me. I think <em>Maisie Dobbs</em> will always be very tightly held in my affections, because it was my first book and was written at a difficult time in my life, when I was recovering from a horrible accident. The other choice would be The <em>Mapping of Love and Death</em>, because it was inspired by the true story of a soldier whose remains lay under Belgian soil for some 90 years until unearthed by a farmer. I learned more about him when I became involved in the quest to discover his origins. When I look at that book, I think of a young man lost to war who was never identified and who was eventually laid to rest as &#x201c;A Soldier of The Great War, Known Unto God.&#x201d; I ache for the parents who never knew where their son died, for he had probably been listed as &#x201c;Missing, Presumed Dead.&#x201d;</p> <p></p><p>In the summer of 1932, Maisie Dobbs' career takes an exciting new turn when she accepts her first assignment for the British Secret Service. Posing as a junior lecturer, she is sent to a private college in Cambridge to monitor any activities "not in the interests of His Majesty's government."</p><p>When the college's controversial pacifist founder and principal, Greville Liddicote, is murdered, Maisie is directed to stand back as Scotland Yard spearheads the investigation. She soon discovers, however, that the circumstances of Liddicote's death appear inextricably linked to the suspicious comings and goings of faculty and students under her surveillance.</p><p>To unravel this web, Maisie must overcome a reluctant Secret Service, discover shameful hidden truths about Britain's conduct during the Great War, and face off against the rising powers of the the Nazi Party in Britain&#x2014;all as the storm clouds of World War II gather on the horizon.</p></p><h2>My Ex-Life: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>National Bestseller</b><br><b>Best Book of the Year: NPR, Shelf Awareness</b></p><p>&#x201c;I didn't know how much I needed a laugh until I began reading Stephen McCauley's new novel, <i>My Ex-Life</i>.

Although de Regniers maintains the traditional storyline, the combination of her mastery and the skill of legendary illustrator Edward Gorey make the fable feel completely new.<p> De Regniers's verse, while it does rhyme, is by no means sing-song and is at times even delightfully puzzling. Phrases and exclamations dangle from the beginnings and ends of couplets--at first glance slightly misplaced, but also somehow appropriate and enriching. (All the better to amuse you with, my dear.) The illustrations are, in typical Gorey fashion, simultaneously spare and expressive. Though the drawings are primarily black and white, specific and random items are colored scarlet: the wolf's tongue, the grandmother's slippers, the feather in the woodsman's cap, and of course, the titular riding hood. (All the better to entrance you with, my dear.) Even if your kids know the story of "Red Riding Hood" by heart, this edition, with its unusual verse and priceless illustrations, will win their special and undivided attention. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i></p>A fresh version of a famous tale [with] a satisfying unity. -- <i>The Horn Book</i><br><br>The verse is easy, lilting, with unexpected twists; Gorey's solemn-sly drawings ... are properly ungory. -- <i>The New York Times</i></p><h2>Inheritor (Foreigner 3)</h2><p>Six months after the return of the alien atevi to the human colony it had placed there two centuries earlier, the rise of a polarizing political faction threatens to send the fledgling planet into war, and three people become a society&#39;s only hope.</p><p><b>C.

A man of deep and wide learning and an extremely prolific author, Panikkar is equally at home in various religious and cultural traditions and embodies in himself the ideals of intercultural, intrareligious, and interreligious dialogues. This book explicates Panikkar&#39;s basic vision of life as the harmonious rhythm of divinity, humanity, and the cosmos, which he terms cosmotheandrism, and shows how it permeates and illumines his articulations of the central Christian doctrines. Given the complexity and difficulty of Panikkar&#39;s thought this book is a welcome companion for a course on Panikkar and for a general reader who wishes to understand one of the most profound and orginal thinkers of our time.</p><p></p><h2>Medieval English Gardens</h2><p>Studies the design, beauty, and practical usage of medieval herb and vegetable gardens, orchards, and vineyards, ascertaining their horticultural, as well as social, religious, and medical importance</p><p></p><h2>History of the World in Bite-Sized Chunks</h2><p>1 HARDCOVER BOOK WITH DUST COVER</p><p></p><h2>Sade My Neighbour (Encounter)</h2><p>Shipped from UK, please allow 10 to 21 business days for arrival.

Now, deep within the belly of the U.S. military establishment, one small silver canister of Wet Eye is missing-lost because a career pencil-pusher has cut a million-dollar deal and signed it in blood.<br><br>For David Stafford, a Defense Department investigator, finding the missing canister means ripping through layers of cover-ups, bureaucracy, and one man's murderous determination to sell Wet Eye to an international arms dealer. But the military would rather silence Stafford than admit to a security breach. And now, the only person who can stop a biological conflagration is an innocent child-who has looked into the face of evil, and seen it with her own two eyes...<br><br></p><p>P.T. Deutermann's latest is a topnotch topical thriller bursting with the expected expertise and insider knowledge he picked up as a Navy captain and arms control specialist. It's also something else: an unexpectedly resonant portrait of people, good and bad, who have been chewed up and spit out by military bureaucracies. Both the hero (an unlucky military investigator named David Stafford, whose career has been short-circuited by whistle-blowing and whose personal life is a disaster area) and the heavy (a career Army bean counter and petty thief, Wendell Carson, who suddenly gets the chance to move up and almost blows it at every occasion) are carefully drawn and fully credible. So are the underlings, officers and FBI agents who thread through their lives. This becomes especially important when Stafford--trying to track down a container of deadly biological nerve gas that Carson has stolen from an Army base in Georgia--crosses paths with a young girl who seems to have psychic powers. In less skilled hands, this kind of rogue element could send a vehicle skittering. But Deutermann quickly gives the girl and her keepers (a mysteriously intriguing woman teacher, a protective small-town policeman) such a strong presence that they become vital to the story's exciting and moving conclusion.

They couldn't be more wrong.<br><br>In this unprecedented new book, Alan Schwarz - whom bestselling <i>Moneyball</i> author Michael Lewis calls "one of today's best baseball journalists" - provides the first-ever history of baseball statistics, showing how baseball and its numbers have been inseparable ever since the pastime's birth in 1845. He tells the history of this obsession through the lives of the people who felt it most: Henry Chadwick, the 19th-century writer who invented the first box score and harped endlessly about which statistics mattered and which did not; Allan Roth, Branch Rickey's right-hand numbers man with the late-1940s Brooklyn Dodgers; Earnshaw Cook, a scientist and Manhattan Project veteran who retired to pursue inventing the perfect baseball statistic; John Dewan, a former Strat-O-Matic maven who built STATS Inc. into a multimillion-dollar powerhouse for statistics over the Internet; and dozens more.<br><br>Almost every baseball fan for 150 years has been drawn to the game by its statistics, whether through newspaper box scores, the backs of Topps baseball cards, <i>The Baseball Encyclopedia</i>, or fantasy leagues. Today's most ardent stat scientists, known as "sabermetricians," spend hundreds of hours coming up with new ways to capture the game in numbers, and engage in holy wars over which statistics are best. Some of these men - and women -- are even being hired by major league teams to bring an understanding of statistics to a sport that for so long shunned it.<br><br>Taken together, Schwarz paints a history not just of baseball statistics, but of the soul of the sport itself. <i>The Numbers Game</i> will be an invaluable part of any fan's library and go down as one of the sport's classic books.<br></p><p><p>Alan Schwarz is an investigative reporter for The New York Times and the author of The Numbers Game: Baseball's Lifelong Fascination with Statistics and Once Upon a Game: Baseball's Greatest Memories.</p><p></p><p>He was a finalist for the 2010 Pulitzer Prize in Public Service for his reporting on the effect of concussions in sports, which was credited with improving safety policies both among athletes and the military.</p><p></p><p>Before joining the Times in 2007, Schwarz was known primarily as the Senior Writer of Baseball America magazine, a columnist for ESPN.com and a frequent contributor to dozens of national publications.</p><p>Read other articles by Alan Schwarz.</p>Sports journalist Schwarz brings to the fore this intelligent, smartly researched and often hilarious look at the use of statistics in baseball, which Schwarz definitively shows to "date back to the game's earliest days in the 19th century." It will delight any fan who memorizes the numbers on the back of trading cards or pores over newspaper box scores. The book's success is rooted in its focus on the people "obsessed with baseball's statistics ever since the box score started it all in 1845," rather than being about the statistics themselves. The reader is presented with enthusiastic but unvarnished looks at such key figures as Henry Chadwick, whose love for numbers led to his inventing the box score grid that remains, Schwarz shows, "virtually unchanged to this day"; Allan Roth, the numbers man hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers who was as important to the team's success as its famed GM Branch Rickey; and the all-but-forgotten work of George Lindsey, one of the first people to apply statistical analysis to weigh various baseball strategies. Delivered in a delightfully breezy and confident style, this volume also serves as an excellent alternate or parallel history of the sport, as we see how the statistics influenced the game itself&#x2014;such as the banning of the spitball&#x2014;as much as they were used to detail individual games.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A foreword by E. John Bullard, the director of the New Orleans Museum of Art; an introduction by Rodrigue&#x2019;s archivist and wife, Wendy Wolfe Rodrigue; and explanatory text by the artist himself provide a foundation for understanding the prints within the personal and cultural context in which they were created.</p><p>Wendy Wolfe Rodrigue and George Rodrigue met when Wendy was a graduate art history student at Tulane University. She has written extensively about her husband&#x2019;s work, catalogued his vast archive, and curated numerous shows featuring his paintings and prints.<br><br>E. John Bullard has been the director of the New Orleans Museum of Art since 1973. He is the author of several exhibition catalogues and books about Edgar Degas and Mary Cassatt.<br>The blue dog stares out from the image, one ear up, paws out in front. Is it a menacing or pleading stare? Is this a dangerous pooch or a mournful one? However it's interpreted, the Blue Dog is a compelling image that has appealed to millions and has made its creator, George Rodrigue, an artistic icon. More fascinated with his Blue Dog than Warhol was with his soup cans, Rodrigue has used silk screening to replicate, in a variety of settings both real and imagined, his version of the Cajun loup-garou&#x2014;the mythological werewolf imported by the French. The dog dominates Rodrigue's career and his catalogue raisonn�, which purposely downplays Rodrigue's early folk paintings of bayou scenes. Neither the foreword by Bullard, director of the New Orleans Museum or Art, nor wife and curator Wendy Wolfe Rodrigue's introduction nor the artist's commentaries provide much insight into his dramatic shift of style. Rodrigue writes, Some are offended by what I've done and especially with the fact that I continue. But that is the creative process. So despite many beautiful illustrations, lavish production qualities and the charm of the Blue Dog, the book offers little insight into an artistic obsession. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Paying tribute to music's realization by musicians and singers, she argues that operatic works are indelibly bound to the contingency of live singing, playing, and staging. She seeks a middle ground between operas as abstractions and performance as the phenomenon that brings opera into being.</p><br><p> Weaving between opera's "facts of life" and a series of works including <i>The Magic Flute, Parsifal</i>, and<i> Pell�as</i>, Abbate explores a spectrum of attitudes towards musical performance, which range from euphoric visions of singers as creators to uncanny images of musicians as lifeless objects that have been resuscitated by scripts. In doing so, she touches upon several critical issues: the Wagner problem; coloratura, virtuosity, and their critics; the implications of disembodied voice in opera and film; mechanical music; the mortality of musical sound; and opera's predilection for scenes positing mysterious unheard music. An intersection between transcendence and intense physical grounding, she asserts, is a quintessential element of the genre, one source of the rapture that operas and their singers can engender in listeners.</p><br><br><p> <i>In Search of Opera</i> mediates between an experience of opera that can be passionate and intuitive, and an intellectual engagement with opera as a complicated aesthetic phenomenon. Marrying philosophical speculation to historical detail, Abbate contemplates a central dilemma: the ineffability of music and the diverse means by which a fugitive art is best expressed in words. All serious devotees of opera will want to read this imaginative book by s music-critical virtuoso.</p></p><p><p>"<i>In Search of Opera</i> is powerful, original, and important. Carolyn Abbate is a highly distinctive voice in the field of opera studies. Her capacity to disturb easy orthodoxies is astonishing. She brings philosophical sophistication to everything she treats. And she is a lovely writer."--<b>Paul Robinson, Stanford University</b></p><p>"These essays represent a breakthrough performance, building on the author's widely admired scholarly publications but pressing out into fascinating mediations on philosophical matters inspired by the experience of music. There are gifts throughout. The chapter on <i>The Magic Flute</i> is by itself worth more than the price of the book."--<b>Stanley Cavell, Harvard University</b></p><p>"This book, which could be described broadly as a deconstruction of musical performance, is itself a performance. It is a work of great intellectual distinction in a field that doesn't have many such. Poetic, too. Abbate is one of those few critics for whom, one feels, criticism is an art."--<b>Joseph Kerman, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"Abbate's brilliant study is likely to challenge readers and reshape thinking about opera for years to come"--<b>M.

Through a dizzingly constructed labyrinth of secrets, the magic of books, passion, and friendship blend into a masterful story. </p> <strong>Carlos Ruiz Zaf�n on <i>The Angel's Game</i></strong><br><br> Years ago, when I began working on my fifth novel, <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i>, I started toying around with the idea of creating a fictional universe that would be articulated through four interconnected stories in which we would meet some of the same characters at different times in their lives, and see them from different perspectives where many plots and subplots would tie around in knots for the reader to untie. It sounds somewhat pretentious, but my idea was to add a twist to the story and provide the reader with what I hoped would be a stimulating and playful reading experience. Since these books were, in part, about the world of literature, books, reading and language, I thought it would be interesting to use the different novels to explore those themes through different angles and to add new layers to the meaning of the stories. <br> <p>At first I thought this could be done in one book, but soon I realized it would make <i>Shadow of the Wind</i> a monster novel, and in many ways, destroy the structure I was trying to design for it. I realized I would have to write four different novels. They would be stand-alone stories that could be read in any order. I saw them as a Chinese box of stories with four doors of entry, a labyrinth of fictions that could be explored in many directions, entirely or in parts, and that could provide the reader with an additional layer of enjoyment and play. These novels would have a central axis, the idea of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, set against the backdrop of a highly stylized, gothic and mysterious Barcelona. Since each novel was going to be complex and difficult to write, I decided to take one at a time and see how the experiment evolved on its own in an organic way.</p> <p>It all sounds very complicated, but it is not. At the end of the day, these are just stories that share a universe, a tone and some central themes and characters. You don&#x2019;t need to care or know about any of this stuff to enjoy them. One of the fun things about this process was it allowed me to give each book a different personality. Thus, if <i>Shadow of the Wind</i> is the nice, good girl in the family, <i>The Angel&#x2019;s Game</i> would be the wicked gothic stepsister. Some readers often ask me if <i>The Angel&#x2019;s Game</i> is a prequel or a sequel. The answer is: none of these things, and all of the above. Essentially <i>The Angel&#x2019;s Game</i> is a new book, a stand-alone story that you can fully enjoy and understand on its own. But if you have already read <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i>, or you decide to read it afterwards, you&#x2019;ll find new meanings and connections that I hope will enhance your experience with these characters and their adventures. </p> <i>The Angel&#x2019;s Game</i> has many games inside, one of them with the reader. It is a book designed to make you step into the storytelling process and become a part of it. In other words, the wicked, gothic chick wants your blood. Beware. Maybe, without realizing, I ended up writing a monster book after all... Don&#x2019;t say I didn&#x2019;t warn you, courageous reader. I&#x2019;ll see you on the other side. <i>--Carlos Ruiz Zaf�n</i><p></p> <p>(Photo � Isolde Ohlbaum) </p>Carlos Ruiz Zaf�n is the author of <b>The Shadow of the Wind</b> and other novels.

Abel Jones, special agent to the Federal Army, takes on New Orleans in this satisfying sixth installment to Parry's humorous, well-written and meticulously researched series of Civil War mysteries. Dispatched to investigate the murder of a Northern heiress&#x2013;cum&#x2013;crusading abolitionist, our reluctant hero finds that despite the bitter cold of the winter of 1863, "New Orleans burns torrid." On his incredible first day in the Crescent City, Jones gives chase to a voodoo woman and survives kidnapping, being buried alive, a midnight gunfight, a venomous snake and paralysis by a poison charm. This is just business as usual for the puritanical Welshman, who fearlessly forges ahead with the assistance of Barnaby B. Barnaby, the rotund former haberdasher from earlier Abel Jones novels. While the rollicking plot pulls the reader along, Parry also sheds new light on Jones's character, juxtaposing his ardent Methodism against an exotic Francophone city and its outr� denizens. Jones holds firm to his strict ethics and disapproval of others' sinful folly&#x2014;as well as everything not Welsh&#x2014;but learns a slightly more pragmatic approach in the face of certain New Orleans realities and superstitions. Though references to previous adventures may perplex newcomers to the series, all will delight in this installment's continuing vivid historical detail and engaging protagonist. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He also lectured and broadcast, via radio and television, on the paranormal in Britain and the United States. In addition to his more than 50 books, he wrote scores of articles and stories for national newspapers and magazines. O'Donnell claimed, "I have investigated, sometimes alone, and sometimes with other people and the press, many cases of reputed hauntings.

This entertaining book takes a fascinating look at the "Swinging Sixties" London scene--all illustrated with photographs, outfits, and ephemera drawn from the V&amp;A's superb archives. This is a personal memoir of a moment--in which fashion insider Geoffrey Aquilina Ross recalls the era's most dashing figures, including Savile Row tailor Tommy Nutter, whose clients included Mick Jagger, the Beatles, and Elton John; photographers Patrick Lichfield and David Bailey; and hairdresser Vidal Sassoon; and discusses iconic London shops such as Granny Takes a Trip, Blades, Hung on You, and Mr Fish.

Three-quarter-page watercolor paintings, outlined with black pen, illustrate a wide variety of subjects ranging from the Black Death to unicorns. While Hunt is successful in conveying his own enthusiasm for the period, the span of time covered and the skimpy information given will do little to aid children's understanding of this rich and diverse period. The choice of subjects is idiosyncratic, and ideas do not build upon one another. Legendary "Arthurian" characters and mythical symbols are mixed at random with flat-footed definitions of terms such as quintain and wattle and daub. Although the text states that dragons, unicorns, and "Excalibur" are legendary, the difference will escape many young readers. The descriptions are frustratingly brief, often hinting at stories untold. The full-color illustrations are dramatic and use many of the rich colors of the period. However, Hunt's attempt to recreate the format of illuminated manuscripts falls short. The large scale of the illustrations overwhelms the slim decorative borders, and cleverly designed capital letters barely hint at the beautiful calligraphy that would have dominated a medieval text. The books listed in the bibliography are primarily for adults, and the ideas illustrated would have most appeal to children with some basic knowledge of history. Both the alphabet format and brief text will be disappointing to them, yet the book lacks the coherent structure necessary for an introduction for younger children. Young readers are better served by David Macaulay's Castle (Houghton, 1977) or Anno's Medieval World (Philomel, 1980) .<br><i>-Eleanor K. MacDonald, Beverly Hills Pub .

In 1989, for Poland&#x2019;s first free election since the Communist takeover, the political party Solidarity dramatically and successfully used that image of Cooper on a campaign poster urging voters to respond to their country&#x2019;s own &#x201c;high noon&#x201d;&#x2015;their critical moment of decision.<br><br>The Western motion picture, from its silent days on, exported an epic vision of America.

But messages were conveyed through subtle means of symbol and color. The Polish poster has been likened to the Trojan horse, with the artist smuggling messages onto the streets in the guise of ephemera.<br><br>The posters displayed so strikingly in this book, and discussed in three essays, are from the golden age of Polish poster-making, the mid-1940s to the 1970s.

They share a marrow-deep hatred of predators but walk different sides of the street when it comes to justice. So when Burke hears that Wolfe has been arrested for attempted murder, he knows something is double-wrong&#x2013;and deals himself in.<br><br>Putting together a distrustful alliance between his &#x201c;family of choice,&#x201d;&nbsp;Wolfe's outlaw network, and an informant inside the police department, Burke starts with the alleged victim, a brutal serial rapist Wolfe had personally prosecuted. He's back on the street because his conviction was reversed, and any of his long list of victims has plenty of motive to kill him. The deeper Burke gets into the investigation, the more holes he finds in the case against Wolfe. Yet the DA's office continues to press forward, and Burke has to find out what their game is. No stranger to devil's bargains, Burke reopens the rape investigations&#x2013;his way&#x2013;and discovers an artist whose violent work in progress is a whole city&#x2019;s nightmare.</p><p>Andrew Vachss has been a federal investigator in sexually transmitted diseases, a social services caseworker, and a labor organizer and has directed a maximum-security prison for youthful offenders.

The only name anyone ever had for me was last seen attached to a body part in the morgue, before the City did whatever it does with unclaimed remains.<br><br>"Somebody" was Gateman's way of saying that whoever was downstairs had come alone...and he'd seen them before. If it had been a stranger, he would have reached under the raw wood plank that holds a register nobody ever signs.

She quick-stepped across the threshold, dragged forword by a barrel-chested Rottweiler she was barely restraining on a short, heavy lead.<br><br>The beast recognized me at once, treated me to his "Back the fuck up!" growl as he thrust his way into the room.<br><br>"Bruiser!" Pepper said, sharply. "Behave!"<br><br>The beast gave her a "Yeah, right!" look, but allowed her to walk him over to the futon couch.<br><br>She sat down, gave me a searching look.<br><br>I didn't say anything, waiting like I always do.

They picked her up at her house, in Queens. She's supposed to be arraigned--"<br><br>"Arrested for what?"<br><br>"Attempted murder, assault, criminal possession of--"<br><br>"Slow down," I told her, breathing shallow through my nose to drop my heart rate. "Start at the beginning."<br><br>Wolfe had been a career sex-crimes prosecutor, a veteran of no-holds-barred combat with the bottom-dwellers in the crime chain--rapists, child molesters, wife beaters. And, sometimes, with certain judges--the ones she called "collaborators" to their faces. A few years ago, she had gotten fired for refusing to soft-hand a "sensitive" case.<br><br>Wolfe wouldn't cross the street and represent the same freaks she used to put away. So she'd gone outlaw, and now she runs the best info-trafficking cell in the City.<br><br>I had wanted Wolfe for my own since the first time I saw her in battle. I'd had--I thought I'd had--a chance with her once. But I had done some things....<br><br>"You and me, it's not going to be," she told me then. And I believed her.<br><br>All that changed was what I did, not how I felt. My love for Wolfe was a dead star. Lightless, invisible in the night sky. But always, always there.<br><br>Pepper's big dark eyes told me she knew some of that. Enough to count on, anyway.<br><br>That's the way it is down here. If you can't be counted on, you can't be counted in.<br><br>"Here's all she could tell me on the phone," Pepper said. "Some man was shot, more than once. He's in a coma, and they don't expect him to live."<br><br>"So what connects Wolfe--?"<br><br>"He named her," Pepper interrupted. "He told the police she was the one who shot him."<br><br>"When was this supposed to have gone down?"<br><br>"I don't know. I don't know anything more about it, not even the man's name. All I know is they're holding her at the precinct, and they expect to arraign her tonight."<br><br>"She's got an alibi," I said, holding Pepper's eyes.<br><br>"She's got plenty of those," Pepper snapped back, telling me I was standing at the end of a long line. And those ahead of me would come across a lot better in court than a two-time felony loser who had been declared dead years ago. "That's not what she needs, right this minute. She needs to--"<br><br>"You got a lawyer for her yet?"<br><br>"No. I thought you might--"<br><br>"Did she tell you to come to me, Pepper?"<br><br>As if to answer my stupid question, the Rottweiler made a gear-grinding noise deep in his chest.<br><br>"No! All she said was to pick up Bruiser and make sure he was all right until they set bail."<br><br>"And you can make--?"<br><br>"I...guess so," Pepper said. "But I don't know a bondsman, either, except for that crook we used the time Mick was--"<br><br>"Never mind," I told her. "Do you know where the arraignment's going to be?"<br><br>"At 100 Centre. She said the...whatever the cops say happened, it happened in Manhattan, so..."<br><br>"Yeah." I glanced at my watch. Three thirty-seven. With the usual backlog from the Tombs and the tour bus from Rikers, they probably wouldn't get to Wolfe until the lobster shift, but I didn't want to chance it. "Give me a minute," I told Pepper.<br>I went into one of the back rooms and pulled a cloned-code cell phone out of its charging unit. I punched in the private number I have for the only criminal lawyer in the City I trust.<br><br>"What?" Davidson answered.<br><br>"You recognize my voice?" I asked. I hadn't spoken to him in years. Not since NYPD found a severed skeletal hand in a Dumpster, right next to a pistol with my thumbprint on the stock.<br><br>"I believe so." He spoke in the pompous voice he uses to distance himself from potential danger in conversations. "Help me out a little bit."<br><br>"It's not my ghost," I said. "I've done some jobs for you, and you've done some for me."<br><br>"Do you have some, uh, distinguishing characteristic I might recognize?"<br><br>"Yeah. I always pay. And that cigar I just heard you light, it's probably from the batch I brought you, a few years back."<br><br>"Very good," he said, chuckling. "You should have been a detective."<br><br>"I need a lawyer. Not for me. For a friend. Being arraigned tonight. Can you handle it?"<br><br>"Can I...? Ah, you mean, will I? Are we talking just for tonight, or...?"<br><br>"To the end of the road," I said. "First-round TKO, or a decision on points. Any way it plays."<br><br>"Would I know this 'friend' of yours?"<br><br>"Yeah. Her name is Wolfe."<br><br>"Wolfe from City-Wide? Are you--?"<br><br>"I'm cancer-serious," I said. "I'm also short on facts. It's either an attempt murder or, by now, a homicide."<br><br>"Wolfe? Are they floridly insane?" he said. "Unless you're talking a DV?"<br><br>"Domestic violence? Wolfe? Come on, pal. Sure, she's not the kind of woman who'd take a beating from a boyfriend. But with that dog of hers, what kind of psycho would even try? No, the vic was a stranger. But he supposedly made a statement."<br><br>"Named her?"<br><br>"What I'm told."<br><br>"Do they have forensics?"<br><br>"You know all I know."<br><br>"And we both know she didn't make a statement."<br><br>"Right. Can you get right over there? I don't know when they're going to arraign her, and--"<br><br>"I'll make some calls, see if I can find out," Davidson said. "But don't worry; I'll be there when they bring her over. I should be able to speak to her in the pens before they--"<br><br>"Listen. She doesn't know about this. Me hiring you, I mean. Just tell her Pepper set it up," I said, looking over at Pepper, catching her nod of agreement, "okay?"<br><br>"Done. My fee will be--"<br><br>"Paid," I said, cutting the connection.<br> "Do you know if they tossed her place?" I asked Pepper.<br><br>"They didn't have a no-knock warrant," she said. "When they pounded on the door, Bruiser went ballistic. She told them she had to lock the dog up before she could let them in--that kept them out of there for a few more minutes."<br><br>"How do you know?"<br><br>"That's how I found out about it. She dialed the office, and left the connection open while she talked to the police. And when she finally let them in, she kept the phone going. I have the whole thing on tape, what they said to her, everything."<br><br>"Did she sound--?"<br><br>"She sounded strong," Pepper said. "One of the cops, he didn't want to cuff her. Another one said it was procedure.

A sense of &#x201c;being different&#x201d; grows to alienation, until he angrily blames this once-enchanting land for his feelings of isolation. Danny&#x2019;s older brother, Luke, travels to a remote island to teach English to the employees of ClockWorld, an ambitious new amusement park that recreates historical events. When Luke doesn&#x2019;t return after two years, Danny travels to ClockWorld to convince Luke to return to America. But Luke has made a new life, new family, and even a new personality for himself on ClockWorld, rendering him almost unrecognizable to his own brother. New School is unlike anything in the history of the comics medium: at once funny and deadly serious, easily readable while wildly artistic, personal and political, familiar and completely new. </li> <li>This Fantagraphics titles was chosen by NPR as among the best books of 2013.</li></ul><br><br></p><p>Dash Shaw lives in Richmond, VA. He was a 2010 Sundance Labs fellow and a 2014&#x2013;2015 Cullman Center fellow at the New York Public Library. A cartoonist, animator, and illustrator, he was born in Los Angeles and attended the School of Visual Arts.For his new, large-format book, Shaw merges the concern with intrafamilial relations that dominated Bottomless Belly Button (2008) and the penchant for sf-fantasy that infused BodyWorld (2010). We first see brothers Luke and Danny as small boys, with Danny ardently idolizing Luke, shadowing his every movement. Years later, their parents send Luke at 17 to an island run by a theme-park developer, where he&#x2019;ll teach the natives conversational English. He&#x2019;s supposed to return in a year but, without ever contacting home, doesn&#x2019;t come back for far longer. Danny, now 16, is dispatched to bring Luke back. But after an elaborate effort that persuades Luke to sabotage the park, does Danny succeed? All along, Danny&#x2019;s had premonitory visions, and the book ends with another, about the brothers&#x2019; future. More enigmatic than Shaw&#x2019;s previous work, New School is a spectacular display of his graphic artistry. He exploits thick lines and masses of black within larger-than-normal panels, over which he throws scrims of color in both single shades and banded blocks of several hues. Stunning enough to be suitable for framing. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Pragmatic Fashions: Pluralism, Democracy, Relativism, and the Absurd (American Philosophy)</h2><p><p>John J. Stuhr, a leading voice in American philosophy, sets forth a view of pragmatism as a personal work of art or fashion. Stuhr develops his pragmatism by putting pluralism forward, setting aside absolutism and nihilism, opening new perspectives on democracy, and focusing on love. He creates a space for a philosophy that is liable to failure and that is experimental, pluralist, relativist, radically empirical, radically democratic, and absurd.

Two sets of twins, the daughters of the Reverend Thomas Latimer, Rector of St. Mark&#x2019;s Church of England in the Shire &amp; City of Corunda, New South Wales.<br> <br>They were sitting on four slender chairs in front of the vast maw of the fireplace, where no fire burned. The very large drawing room was filled with chattering women invited by the Rector&#x2019;s wife, Maude, to celebrate the event looming in less than a week: the Rector&#x2019;s four daughters were quitting the Rectory to commence training as nurses at the Corunda Base Hospital.<br> <br>Less than a week to go, less than a week to go! Edda kept saying to herself as she endured the embarrassment of being on display, her eyes roaming about because she preferred not to look at her stepmother, Maude, dominating the talk as usual, natter, natter, natter.<br> <br>There was a hole in the wooden floor to the side of Edda&#x2019;s chair, the last in the row of four; a movement inside it caught her attention and she stiffened, grinning deep within herself. A big rat! A rat was about to invade Mama&#x2019;s party! Just an inch more, she thought as she watched the head, then I&#x2019;ll emit a loud gasp and screech &#x201c;Rat!&#x201d; at the top of my voice. What fun!<br> <br>But before Edda could find her voice she actually saw the head, and froze. A polished black wedge with vibrating tongue&#x2014;huge for what it was!&#x2014;followed by a polished black body as thick as a woman&#x2019;s arm&#x2014;a black body, yes, but beneath it a red belly. And the thing kept on coming and coming, seven feet of red-bellied black snake, lethally venomous. How had it found its way in here?<br> <br>It was still emerging, ready the moment the tip of its tail was free to make a bolt in some unpredictable direction. The fire tools were on the far side of the hearth, with the oblivious Tufts, Grace, and Kitty in between; she&#x2019;d never reach them.<br> <br>Her chair had a padded seat but no arms, and its frail legs tapered to fine round points no bigger than a lipstick tube; Edda drew in a great breath, lifted herself and the chair a few inches, and brought the left front leg down on the middle of the snake&#x2019;s head. Then she sat, hard and heavy, hands clenched grimly around the sides of the chair seat, determined to ride out the tempest as if she were Jack Thurlow breaking in a horse.<br> <br>The leg pierced its skull between the eyes and the snake, all seven feet of it, reared high into the air. Someone gave a shrill scream and other screams followed, while Edda Latimer sat and fought to keep the chair leg embedded in the snake&#x2019;s head. Its body whipped, pounded, crashed around and against her, dealing her blows more savage and punishing than a man&#x2019;s fist, raining on her so thick and fast that she seemed surrounded by a whirling blur, a threshing shadow.<br> <br>Women were running everywhere, still screaming, eyes filled with the sight of Edda and the old man snake, unable to get past their panic to help her.<br> <br>Except for Kitty&#x2014;pretty Kitty, gritty Kitty&#x2014;who leaped across the hearth wielding the tomahawk used for last-minute splitting of over-chunky kindling. Wading through the lashing snake&#x2019;s blows, she severed head from spine in two hacks.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can take your weight off the chair now, Eds,&#x201d; Kitty said to her sister as she dropped the hatchet. &#x201c;What a monster! You&#x2019;ll be black and blue from bruises.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re mad!&#x201d; sobbed Grace, running tears of shock.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fools!&#x201d; said Tufts fiercely to Edda and Kitty both. The white-faced Reverend Thomas Latimer was too occupied in dealing with his second wife, in rigid hysterics, to do what he longed to do&#x2014;comfort his wonderfully brave daughters.<br> <br>The screams and cries were dying down now, and the terror had diminished sufficiently for some of the more intrepid women to cluster around the snake and inspect its mortality for themselves&#x2014;an enormous thing! And for all that Mrs. Enid Treadby and Mrs. Henrietta Burdum assisted the Rector in soothing Maude, no one except the four twins remembered the original purpose of this ruined gathering. What mattered was that that strange creature Edda Latimer had killed a lethally venomous old man snake, and it was time to run home, there to perpetuate Corunda&#x2019;s main feminine activity&#x2014;Gossip and her attendants, Rumour and Speculation.<br> <br>The four girls moved to an abandoned trolley of goodies, poured tea into frail cups and plundered the cucumber sandwiches.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t women fools?&#x201d; Tufts asked, waving the teapot. &#x201c;You would swear the sky was going to fall in! Typical you, though, Edda. What did you plan to do if the chair leg didn&#x2019;t succeed?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then, Tufts, I would have appealed to you for an idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh! You didn&#x2019;t need to appeal to me because our other brilliant thinker and schemer, Kitty, came to your rescue.&#x201d; Tufts looked around. &#x201c;Stone the crows, they&#x2019;re all going home! Tuck in, girls, we can eat the lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mama will take two days to recover from this,&#x201d; Grace said cheerfully, holding out her cup for more tea. &#x201c;Rather beats the shock of losing her four unpaid Rectory housemaids.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kitty blew a rude noise. &#x201c;Rubbish, Grace! The shock of losing her unpaid housemaids looms far larger in Mama&#x2019;s mind than the death of a snake, no matter how big or poisonous.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s more,&#x201d; said Tufts, &#x201c;the first thing Mama will do when she has recovered is serve Edda a sermon on how to kill snakes with decorum and discretion. You created a rumpus.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dear me, yes, so I did,&#x201d; Edda said placidly, smearing rich red jam and a pile of whipped cream on top of a scone. &#x201c;Yum! If I hadn&#x2019;t made a rumpus, the four of us would never have managed to get a scone. All Mama&#x2019;s cronies would have gobbled them.&#x201d; She laughed. &#x201c;Next Monday, girls! Next Monday we start lives of our own. No more Mama. And you know I don&#x2019;t mean that against you and Tufts, Kitty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know it well,&#x201d; said Kitty gruffly.<br> <br><br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t that Maude Latimer was consciously awful; according to her own lights she was a saint among stepmothers as well as mothers. Grace and Edda had the same father as her own Tufts and Kitty, and there was no discrimination anywhere on the remotest horizon, Maude was quick to tell even the least interested observer of Rectory life. How could four such gorgeous children be irksome to one who adored being a mother? And it might have worked out in reality as it had within Maude&#x2019;s mind, were it not for a physical accident of destiny. Namely that the junior of Maude&#x2019;s twins, Kitty, had a degree of beauty beyond her lovely sisters, whom she surpassed as the sun dims the brilliance of the moon.<br> <br>From Kitty&#x2019;s infancy all the way to today&#x2019;s leaving home party, Maude dinned Kitty&#x2019;s perfections in every ear that came into hearing distance. People&#x2019;s private opinions were identical to Maude&#x2019;s public ones, but oh, how tired everybody got when Maude hove into view, Kitty&#x2019;s hand firmly in hers, and the three other twins walking a pace behind. The consensus of Corunda opinion was that all Maude was really doing was making three implacable enemies for Kitty out of her sisters&#x2014;how Edda, Grace, and Tufts must hate Kitty! People also concluded that Kitty must be unpleasant, spoiled, and insufferably conceited.<br> <br>But it didn&#x2019;t happen that way, though the why was a mystery to everyone save the Rector. He interpreted the love between his girls as solid, tangible evidence of how much God loved them. Of course Maude usurped the praise her husband gave to God as more fairly due to her, and her alone.<br> <br>The Latimer girls pitied Maude quite as much as they disliked her, and loved her only in the way that bonds females of the same family, whether there be a blood tie or not. And what had united the four girls in their unshakable alliance against Maude was not the plight of the three on the outer perimeter of Maude&#x2019;s affections, but the plight of Kitty, upon whom all Maude&#x2019;s affections were concentrated.<br> <br>Kitty should have been a brash and demanding child; instead she was shy, quiet, retiring. Twenty months older, Edda and Grace noticed well before Tufts did, but once all three saw, they became very concerned about what they recognized as their mother&#x2019;s effect on Kitty. Just how the conspiracy among them to shield Kitty from Maude gradually began was lost in the fog of infancy, save that as time went on, the conspiracy became stronger.<br> <br>It was always dominant Edda who took the brunt of the major upheavals, a pattern set when the twelve-year-old Edda caught Kitty attacking her face with a cheese grater, took it from ten-year-old Kitty, and hied her to see Daddy, who was the sweetest and kindest man in the world. And he had dealt with the crisis wonderfully, approaching the problem in the only way he knew, by persuading the little girl that in trying to maim herself, she was insulting God, Who had made her beautiful for some mysterious reason of His own, a reason that one day she would understand.<br> <br>This held Kitty until the beginning of her last year of school, at the Corunda Ladies&#x2019; College, a Church of England institution. By postponing the start of his elder twins&#x2019; education and advancing that of his younger, all four girls went through primary and secondary school in the same class, and matriculated together. The headmistress, a dour Scot, welcomed the eleven girls who stayed at school into their final year with a speech designed to depress their expectations from life rather than encourage them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your parents have permitted you to enjoy the fruits of two to four extra years of education by keeping you at C.L.C. until you matriculate,&#x201d; said she in the rounded tones of one educated at Oxford, &#x201c;which you will do at the end of this Year of Our Lord 1924. By the time that you matriculate, your education will be superb&#x2014;as far as education for women goes. You will have university-entrance grounding in English, mathematics, ancient and modern history, geography, basic science, Latin, and Greek.&#x201d; She paused significantly, then reached her conclusion. &#x201c;However, the most desirable career available to you will be a suitable marriage. If you choose to remain single and must support yourself, there are two careers open to you: teaching in primary school and some few secondary schools, or secretarial work.&#x201d;<br> <br>To which speech Maude Latimer added a postscript over lunch at the Rectory on the next Sunday.<br> <br>&#x201c;What drivel!&#x201d; said Maude with a snort. &#x201c;Oh, not the suitable marriage! Naturally, girls, you will all achieve that. But no daughter of the Rector of St. Mark&#x2019;s needs to soil her hands by working for a living. You will live at home and help me keep house until you marry.&#x201d;<br> <br>In September 1925, when Edda and Grace were nineteen and Tufts and Kitty eighteen, Kitty went to the Rectory stables and found a length of rope. Having fashioned a loop in one end and flung the rope over a beam, Kitty put her head through the loop and climbed onto an empty oil drum. When Edda found her, she had already kicked the drum over and hung, pathetically quiescent, to rid herself of life. Never able to understand afterward where she found the strength, Edda got Kitty free of the choking rope before any real harm was done.<br> <br>This time she didn&#x2019;t take Kitty to the Rector at once. &#x201c;Oh, dearest baby sister, you can&#x2019;t, you can&#x2019;t!&#x201d; she cried, cheek on the silky mop of hair. &#x201c;Nothing can be this bad!&#x201d;<br> <br>But when Kitty was able to croak answers, Edda knew it was even worse.<br> <br>&#x201c;I loathe being beautiful, Edda, I abominate it! If only Mama would shut up, give me some peace! But she doesn&#x2019;t. To anyone who&#x2019;ll listen, I&#x2019;m Helen of Troy. And she&#x2014;she won&#x2019;t let me dress down, or not make up my face&#x2014;Edda, if she could, I swear she&#x2019;d marry me to the Prince of Wales!&#x201d;<br> <br>Edda tried being lighthearted. &#x201c;Even Mama must have realized you&#x2019;re not His Royal Highness&#x2019;s type, Kits. He likes them married, and much older than you are.&#x201d;<br> <br>It did get a watery chuckle, but Edda had to talk for far longer and with every ounce of persuasion she owned before Kitty consented to take her problems to her father.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kitty, you&#x2019;re not alone,&#x201d; Edda argued. &#x201c;Look at me! I&#x2019;d sell my soul to the Devil&#x2014;and I mean that!&#x2014;for the chance to be a doctor. It&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;ve ever wanted, a degree in medicine. But I can&#x2019;t have it. For one thing, there isn&#x2019;t the money, and there never will be the money. For another, Daddy doesn&#x2019;t in his heart of hearts approve&#x2014;oh, not because he&#x2019;s against women in the professions, but because of the terrible time everyone gives women in medicine. He doesn&#x2019;t think it would make me happy. I know he&#x2019;s wrong, but he refuses to be convinced.&#x201d;<br> <br>She took Kitty&#x2019;s arm and squashed it between strong, slender fingers. &#x201c;What makes you think you&#x2019;re the only unhappy one, eh, tell me that? Don&#x2019;t you think I haven&#x2019;t considered hanging myself? Well, I have! Not once, but time and time again.&#x201d;<br> <br>So by the time that Edda broke the news to Thomas Latimer that Kitty had tried to hang herself, Kitty was malleable clay.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, my dear, my dear!&#x201d; he whispered, tears running down his long, handsome face. &#x201c;For the crime of self-murder, God has a special Hell&#x2014;no pit of fire, no company in the suffering. Those who commit self-murder wander the vastnesses of eternity forever alone. They never see another face, hear another voice, taste agony or ecstasy! Swear to me, Katherine, that you will never again try to harm yourself in any way!&#x201d;<br> <br>She had sworn, and adhered to her oath, though all three of her sisters kept a special eye on Kitty.<br> <br>And the attempted suicide turned out to have happened at exactly the proper time, thanks to the fact that the Rector of St. Mark&#x2019;s was a member of the Corunda Base Hospital Board. The week after Kitty&#x2019;s crisis, the Hospital Board met, and among its business was a mention of the fact that in 1926 the New South Wales Department of Health was introducing a new kind of nurse: a properly trained, educated, registered nurse. This, saw the Rector at once, was a career fit for a girl brought up as a lady. What imbued the Rector with greatest enthusiasm was that the new, properly trained nurses would be required to live in the hospital grounds so that they were on a moment&#x2019;s call if needed. The pay after deducting board, uniforms, and books was a pittance, but his girls each had a modest dowry of �500, and the pittance meant they wouldn&#x2019;t need to touch it; Maude was already complaining that four extra mouths at the Rectory were too many to do the housework. Therefore, said the Rector to himself as he sped home in his Model T Ford, why not dangle a nursing career under the noses of his girls? Fit for a lady, living at the hospital, paid a pittance&#x2014;and (though he was too loyal to voice it, even in his mind) freedom from Maude the Destroyer.<br> <br>He tackled Edda first, and of course she was madly, wildly enthusiastic; so even Grace, the most reluctant, was relatively easy to enlist. If the thought of being free of Maude worked more powerfully with Grace and Kitty than the prospect of the work itself, did that really matter?<br> <br>Far harder for the Rector was the single-handed battle he fought on the Hospital Board to persuade his twelve fellow members that Corunda Base should be among the pioneer New Nurse hospitals. Somewhere inside Thomas Latimer&#x2019;s gracefully gangling gazelle of a body there lurked, so forgotten it was positively moth-eaten, a lion. And for the first time in Corunda&#x2019;s memory, the lion roared. Teeth bared, claws unsheathed, the lion was a manifestation of the Reverend Latimer that people like Frank Campbell, the Corunda Base Hospital Superintendent, didn&#x2019;...</p><h2>Land Above the Trees: A Guide to American Alpine Tundra</h2><p>By Ann H.

When the Beckets' smuggling ring, an operation that helps their fellow villagers, is threatened by the notorious Red Men Gang, family friend Jack Eastwood offers to infiltrate London society to root out the gang's leader. Although adopted daughter Eleanor has always been reserved and self-sufficient, quietly running the boisterous Becket household, she shocks everyone by volunteering to play Eastwood's pretend wife in London. Jack quickly discovers that Eleanor's fragile looks hide a sharp mind and steely will, making her a valuable ally, but he suspects she is keeping secrets from him about her past. These secrets become a liability when Jack discovers that Rowley Maddox, the Earl of Chelfham and quite possibly the leader of the Red Men, knows who Eleanor is and what she's hiding. As the cat-and-mouse game intensifies, Jack and Eleanor realize they are destined to do more together than sleuthing&#x2014;just in time for Jack to face losing Eleanor at the hands of Maddox. Lively dialogue and characters make the plot's suspense and pathos resonate; anticipation for the series' next volume, due in 2007, should be high. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The world&#39;s most translated best-selling writer.</p><p>William Butcher has been the leading international authority on Verne for twenty years. His countless articles and eight books on Verne have led him to an unparalleled knowledge of this multi-faceted figure.Butcher has researched the so-called--wrongly, he maintains--father of science fiction for 20 years and newly translated six Verne novels from the best available sources. He utterly contradicts the impression Herbert Lottman's <i>Jules Verne </i>(1996) gave of the novelist as stodgy, unadventurous, and boring. His Verne is almost too interesting. A deferential but determinedly independent son, a diffident suitor and husband, and a clueless and abstracted father, Verne doggedly pursued fortune as well as fame yet let his publisher Hetzel grab the profits through contracts that committed Verne to a grueling workload and allowed Hetzel to ham-handedly alter the manuscripts before publication. An ardent sailor for 30 years, Verne afforded his hobby thanks to proceeds from others' theatrical adaptations of his best-sellers, especially <i>Around the World in Eighty Days--</i>ironically, since he craved success as a playwright, not a novelist. And he didn't write science fiction, or about science at all, he said, because he didn't know, like, or trust science. His novels made him "the most read of all writers--nine times as much as the next Frenchman." If that statement begs the question of how it was ascertained, Butcher's speculations about Verne's possible homosexuality call for a dash of salt. There are tangential howlers here, too--pace Butcher, John Brown wasn't murdered in 1856; he was executed <i>for</i> murder in 1859--but neither they nor Butcher's overreachings dim the fascination <i>this</i> Jules Verne radiates. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Wood pulp, vegetable or cotton fibers are beaten down, mixed with water and pressed into paper. This organic composition provides the tensile strength yet the flexibility needed for delicate manipulation. A flat piece of paper can be very deceiving. Those who recognize its versatility and limitations are gifted with a boundless palette from which to create. Paper can be curled, rolled, folded or scored without tearing. A knowledge of flexibility, weight and texture, through hands-on application, will result in your ability to create paper sculpture images. With few cuts and gentle curves, paper is transformed from a flat surface into a 3-Dimensional network of light and shadow. Crush a piece of paper in your hand and gently flatten it out.

From its beginnings in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, to its heyday in the twenties and thirties, to its decline and extinction in the 1950s, steam logging captured the imaginations and hearts of generations of Oregonians. In Search of Steam Donkeys traces the development of the machinery that made steam logging possible-and sometimes dangerous, sometimes lucrative. It describes the surprisingly creative methods that old-time loggers used, modified (and sometimes misused) the equipment they worked with daily; the sometimes funny, frequently poignant, tales of living and growing up in a logging camp; the reminiscences of those who still remember working as whistle punks, riggers, donkey doctors, and hooktenders.</p><p></p><h2>Glencoe McGraw Hill Algebra 1, Teacher Edition</h2><p>Hardcover teacher edition, copyright 2010</p><p></p><h2>Brendan the Navigator</h2><p>Portrays the life of Saint Brendan and chronicles his legendary voyage to North America long before the Vikings arrived</p><p>Acclaimed biographer, Jean Fritz, was born in China where she lived until the age of thirteen.

Australian surf culture is over a century old, and it still hasn&#39;t grown up. From its roots as an illegal pastime to its current incarnation as a professional sport, surfing&#39;s enduring appeal has always been the carefree, quintessentially Australian lifestyle that goes with it. Australian surf culture has always had competing impulses of chaos and order. For every Boot Hill Gang there is a Surf Life Saving Association; for every tragic drug disqualification, a World Title winner. From Tommy Tanna, Alick Wickham and Freddie Williams&#39;s pioneering surf lifestyles to the hedonism of 1950s beach culture, the Coolangatta Kids of the 1970s, to the eventual professionalised machine that surfing in Australia has now become, this is the complete, no-holds-barred history of both sides of the story. With forewords by Mark Richards and Layne Beachley, Australia&#39;s World Champion surfers, this book is the definitive history of surfing in Australia.</p><p>Includes bibliographical references (p. 338-342) and index.</p><h2>A Search for the King</h2><p>Kidnapped and held to ransom by Duke Leopold of Austria after the Third Crusade, Richard the Lion Heart, it is said, was found by his faithful troubadour Blondel de Neel.

The other five demigods have to put aside their grief and follow Percy's instructions to find the mortal side of the Doors of Death. If they can fight their way through the Gaea's forces, and Percy and Annabeth can survive the House of Hades, then the Seven will be able to seal the Doors from both sides and prevent the giants from raising Gaea. But, Leo wonders, if the Doors are sealed, how will Percy and Annabeth be able to escape? They have no choice. If the demigods don't succeed, Gaea's armies will never die. They have no time. In about a month, the Romans will march on Camp Half-Blood. The stakes are higher than ever in this adventure that dives into the depths of Tartarus.</p><p><strong>Rick Riordan </strong>(www.rickriordan.com) is the author of the # 1 <em>New York Times</em> best-selling <em>The Heroes of Olympus, Book One: The Lost Hero</em>; <em>The Heroes of Olympus, Book Two: The Son of Neptune</em>; <em>The Heroes of Olympus, Book Three: The Mark of Athena</em>; the<em> #1 New York Times</em> best-selling <em>Kane Chronicles; </em>and<em> </em>the five books in the #1 <em>New York Times</em> best-selling Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. His previous novels for adults include the hugely popular Tres Navarre series, winner of the top three awards in the mystery genre. He lives in San Antonio, Texas, with his wife and two sons.Gr 5-8 Fans won't be disappointed as the cliff-hanger ending from the previous book, The Mark of Athena (Hyperion, 2012), leads to further exciting adventures by the intrepid demigods in this penultimate book in the "Heroes of Olympus" series. Annabeth and Percy have fallen down into Tantarus, and they must fight off the attacks from the monsters stuck there long enough to find the Doors of Death. The other five demigods must get to Eprius in Greece, find the House of Hades to open the Doors of Death on the mortal side, save Annabeth and Percy, and seal the entrance to stop Gaea's forces from escaping into the mortal world and destroying it. The Gods are incapacitated by their Greek and Roman personalities warring with one another, and the demigods from Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter are on the verge of an all-out war. As Annabeth and Percy struggle to survive Tantarus's poisonous atmosphere and creatures, the other demigods must undergo harsh trials particularly Hazel, Frank, and Leo, but they learn and grow mentally and physically from their experiences. The heroes realize that they cannot change their parentage but they can control their legacy. While more serious than the previous titles, there are lighthearted moments here, many involving a farting polecat. The horrifying monsters are nicely balanced by peace-loving Titan Bob, a skeleton calico cat called Small Bob, and gentle giant Damasen. Fans will be thrilled to know the series continues with The Blood of Olympus in 2014. Sharon Rawlins, New Jersey State Library, Trenton SLJ"<br><br>Having plunged into Tartarus at the end of the last book, The Mark of Athena (2013), Percy and Annabeth struggle toward the Doors of Death, while their friends hurry to meet them on the other side at the titular House of Hades. Riordan is most successful in his evocation of Tartarus and its hellish, monster-infested landscape. Without lightening his heroes' miseries in any way, the author provides a helper and necessary mood-lifter in the person of Iapetus/Bob, the Titan whose memory Percy had obliterated with the waters of Lethe in a previous adventure. Now Hades' janitor, Bob, along with a skeletal saber-tooth kitten he names Small Bob, joins Percy and Annabeth on their trek, causing them both to plumb unexpected moral depths. Meanwhile, on board (and off) the Argo II, Jason, Piper, Leo, Hazel and Frank similarly must come to understand themselves better in order to accomplish the tasks set before them (though not to equal extents). Though Riordan doesn't stint on action or laughs (fart jokes abound, and a tart-tongued Calypso is a special treat), readers may find themselves appreciating these moments of contemplation all the more for the depth of characterization they reveal. The denouement finds the demigods poised for the final battle with Gaea and her minions; they have exactly 14 days to save the world. In this adventure, victories are hard-won and the essence of bravery nuanced, making the journey as satisfying as it is entertaining. (Fantasy. 10-14) Kirkus"<br><br>For Percy Jackson fans, it's been a long year since the cliffhanger at the end of The Mark of Athena(2012). Now Riordan picks up the story and carries it to a rewarding conclusion, with the main set of characters reunited and preparing themselves for the final showdown with Gaea. Throughout the book, Percy and Annabeth make their harrowing way through the underworld to the Doors of Death. Meanwhile, Hazel, Leo, Frank, Piper, Jason, Nico, and Reyna endure their own perils, all the way through to the story's climax. In addition to experiencing growth spurts, several of the teen demigods take significant steps toward understanding their powers, accepting their feelings, trusting each other, and taking responsibility for leadership. Adventure fans will relish the action as their heroes confront formidable foes, while readers who have come to love the characters will enjoy following the different individuals as they take the stage in scenes that are usually dramatic, often witty, and occasionally surprising. A satisfying, penultimate entry in the Heroes of Olympus series. - Carolyn Phelan Booklist Online"</p><h2>Duchess by Deception (Gilded)</h2><p><b>In <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Marie Force&#x2019;s dazzling historical romance debut, the clock is ticking for a wealthy Duke who must marry by his thirtieth birthday&#x2014;or lose his title . . .</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Derek Eagan, the dashing Duke of Westwood, is well aware of his looming deadline.

Explaining the very serious differences between the Zooks and the Yooks, a Zook grandpa tells his grandchild the unspeakable truth: "It's high time that you knew of the terribly horrible thing that Zooks do. In every Zook house and every Zook town <i>every Zook eats his bread with the butter side down!</i>" He then recalls his days with the Zook-Watching Border Patrol, as he gave any Zook who dared come close "a twitch with my tough-tufted prickley Snick-Berry Switch." But when the Zooks fought back, the switches gave way to Triple-Sling Jiggers, then Jigger-Rock Snatchems--even a Kick-a-Poo Kid that was "loaded with powerful Poo-a-Doo Powder and ants' eggs and bees' legs and dried-fried clam chowder."<p> With lots of fun and more-than-fair digs at the runaway spending and one-upmanship of U.S.-Soviet days, <i>The Butter Battle Book</i> makes a chuckle-filled read whether you're old enough to get the historical references or not.

He creates an intimate and immediate connection with his subject so that the book reads like the work of a contemporary, meeting Shakespeare on his own ground. Written with intuition and imagination unique to Peter Ackroyd, this is a book by a writer about a writer, and a fascinating and detailed depiction of the world Shakespeare inhabited.</p><p>With his magisterial and ingenious re-creations of the lives of Chaucer, Dickens, T. S. Eliot, William Blake, and Sir Thomas More, Peter Ackroyd has long been recognized as today's foremost practitioner of the literary biography. His adroit style and unrivaled ability to uncover the telling detail have made those books both critical and commercial successes. And now, in SHAKESPEARE: THE BIOGRAPHY, Ackroyd delivers his crowning achievement. <br>Thousands of books have been written about the playwright, but none has borne Ackroyd's unique and accessible stamp. His method is to position Shakespeare in the context of his world, exploring everything from Stratford's humble town to its fields of wildflowers; discerning influences on the plays from unexpected quarters; and entering London with the playwright as modern theater, as we know it, is just beginning to emerge. <br>We are with Shakespeare, observing him and his circle of friends, patrons, managers, and fellow actors and writers. It is as if Ackroyd were sitting with the Elizabethan audience as the plays are performed. <br>Because the author is coming from so intimate a perspective, he is able to see Shakespeare's genius from within, so we feel that Ackroyd the writer merges with Shakespeare the writer, the poet, the man; and thus with great sympathy and clarity we experience the way in which Shakespeare worked. <br>SHAKESPEARE: THE BIOGRAPHY is unlike the works other writers-excellent academics-have written, which merely analyze and describe. Rather, Peter Ackroyd has used his skill, his extraordinary knowledge, and his historical intuition to craft this major full-scale book on one of the most towering figures of the Englishlanguage.<b>Peter Ackroyd</b> is a bestselling writer of both fiction and nonfiction. His most recent books include<i> The Lambs of London; Shakespeare: The Biography</i>; and <i>J.M.W. Turner</i>, the second biography in the Ackroyd Brief Lives series. He has also written full-scale biographies of <i>Dickens, Blake, </i>and <i>Thomas More </i>and the novels<i> The Clerkenwell Tales</i>, <i>The Trial of Elizabeth Cree, Milton in America, </i>and <i>The Plato Papers. </i>He has won the Whitbread Award for Biography, the Royal Society of Literature Award under the William Heinemann Bequest (jointly), the Somerset Maugham Award, the South Bank Award for Literature, and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and <i>The Guardian</i> fiction prize.

The Bezels of Wisdom was written during the author&#39;s later years and was intended to be a synthesis of his spiritual doctrine. Bezel means a setting in which a gem, engraved with one&#39;s name, is set to make a seal ring. The setting in which Ibn Al-&#39;Arabi has placed his spiritual wisdom are the lives of the prophets. It was in Damascus that he had the vision that prompted him to write this book. He describes it in his preface: &#34;I saw the Apostle of God in a visitation...He had in his hand a book and he said to me, &#39;This is the book of the bezels of Wisdom; take it and bring it to men that they might benefit from it.&#39;&#34; The book portrays the wisdom of love through Abraham, of the unseen through Job, of light through Joseph, of intimacy through Elias and so on.

But the story of Tibetan resistance weaves a far richer tapestry than anyone might have imagined.<br><br>Kenneth Conboy and James Morrison reveal how America's Central Intelligence Agency encouraged Tibet's revolt against China&#x2014;and eventually came to control its fledgling resistance movement. While the CIA's presence in Tibet has been alluded to in other works, the authors provide the first comprehensive, as well as most compelling account of this little known agency enterprise.<br><br><i>The CIA's Secret War in Tibet</i> takes readers from training camps in the Colorado Rockies to the scene of clandestine operations in the Himalayas, chronicling the agency's help in securing the Dalai Lama's safe passage to India and subsequent initiation of one of the most remote covert campaigns of the Cold War. Establishing a rebel army in the northern Nepali kingdom of Mustang and a para-commando force in India designed to operate behind Chinese lines, Conboy and Morrison provide previously unreported details about secret missions undertaken in extraordinarily harsh conditions. Their book greatly expands on previous memoirs by CIA officials by putting virtually every major agency participant on record with details of clandestine operations. It also calls as witnesses the people who managed and fought in the program&#x2014;including Tibetan and Nepalese agents, Indian intelligence officers, and even mission aircrews.<br><br>Conboy and Morrison take pains to tell the story from all perspectives, particularly that of the former Tibetan guerrillas, many of whom have gone on record here for the first time. The authors also tell how Tibet led America and India to become secret partners over the course of several presidential administrations and cite dozens of Indian and Tibetan intelligence documents directly related to these covert operations. Ultimately, they are persuasive that the Himalayan operations were far more successful as a proving ground for CIA agents who were later reassigned to southeast Asia than as a staging ground for armed rebellion. <br><br>As the movement for Tibetan liberation continues to attract international support, Tibet's status remains a contentious issue in both Washington and Beijing. This book takes readers inside a covert war fought with Tibetan blood and U. S. sponsorship and allows us to better understand the true nature of that controversy.</p><p>"The inside story of one of the CIA's most tragic covert operations.

"How is George Washington's face on a bunion going to save the farm?"</p><p>"Minnie, don't you see?" said Moo. "Everyone loves an oddity. Everyone loves a mystery. They may say they don't, but sooner or later curiosity gets the better of them. There isn't an animal on this farm who wouldn't pay to see a bunion with the face of the father of our country on it."</p><p>Moo pointed to Minnie's bump. <i>"That,"</i> she said, "is a presidential bunion!"</p><p>"Really?" said Minnie.</p><p>"Really," said Moo, pacing back and forth again. "But George will be free of charge. We need to convince everyone that what we say is true.

Life's puzzles, the unexplained, the wonders of the world. That's it! <i>See the Seven Wonders of the World!"</i></p><p>Minnie stood up and looked across the farm. "Moo, I don't see any wonders," she said. "I see a farmhouse, a barn, and some chickens."</p><p>"But I do," said Moo. "I see the Presidential Bunion. I see the Bermuda Triangle.

"Who's Big Hoof?"</p><p>"You've never heard of Big Hoof?"</p><p>Minnie shook her head.</p><p>"They say Big Hoof is the missing link between dinosaurs and cows. Some animals claim to have seen her in Wilkerson's Woods. Her footprints are huge."</p><p>Minnie looked toward the dark woods at the edge of the farm. "Really?" she said.</p><p>"Well, I've never seen her," said Moo. "But listen, Minnie. No one will believe your bunion has the face of George Washington on it. But once they see it, they will believe it. After that they'll believe anything!"</p><p>Minnie shook her head. "You make me nervous," she said. "Every time you get an idea, it starts up one way and ends up another."</p><p>"Minnie," said Moo softly, "I'm just trying to save the farm."</p><p>"I know," said Minnie. "But it sounds like...like...cheating."</p><p>"No, no," said Moo. "It's being creative. It's more like taking something old and making something new out of it. Like making up your own recipe."</p><p>Minnie let out a tired breath of air. She looked at Moo. "Making up your own recipe?" she said. </p><p>"Yes," said Moo. "All you have to do is take a little something that's sort of true and mix it with something that's sort of not true. Then you toss it around a little and sauce it up a bit. Soon you have something new, different, more interesting, and more tasty."</p><p>"Sounds like a salad," said Minnie.</p><p>"No," said Moo thoughtfully. "More like a bowl of mock turtle soup. There really isn't any turtle in mock turtle soup, but it's still a bowl of soup."</p><p>"More like a bowl of fibs," said Minnie. "I don't like it!"</p><p>Minnie looked out over the farm. She saw her friends Bea and Madge Holstein standing near the chicken coop talking to some mutual friends. She saw the farmer going into the barn next to his tractor and Mrs. Farmer carrying out the wash. Minnie remembered all the wonderful years everyone at the farm had spent together.</p><p>Moo sighed.</p><p>"Minnie," she said, "what will happen to all the animals on the farm if we don't do something?"</p><p>"We?" Minnie said. "How does it always end up with 'we'? Your ideas are like an invisible net. You cast it out as 'I' and it comes back loaded with 'we.'"</p><p>Moo smiled at Minnie.</p><p>"Okay, okay!"

This included political surveillance, eavesdropping, detention, and interrogation. The revelation of illegal activities over many years shocked the American public and led to investigations of the CIA by a presidential commission and committees in both houses of Congress, which found evidence of more abuse, even CIA plans for assassinations. Investigators and the public soon discovered that the CIA abuses were described in a top-secret document agency insiders dubbed the &#x201c;Family Jewels.&#x201d; That document became ground zero for a political firestorm that lasted more than a year. The &#x201c;Family Jewels&#x201d; debacle ultimately brought about greater congressional oversight of the CIA, but excesses such as those uncovered in the 1970s continue to come to light. The Family Jewels probes the deepest secrets of the CIA and its attempts to avoid scrutiny. John Prados recounts the secret operations that constituted &#x201c;Jewels&#x201d; and investigators&#x2019; pursuit of the truth, plus the strenuous efforts&#x2014;by the agency, the executive branch, and even presidents&#x2014;to evade accountability. Prados reveals how Vice President Richard Cheney played a leading role in intelligence abuses and demonstrates that every type of &#x201c;Jewel&#x201d; has been replicated since, especially during the post-9/11 war on terror. The Family Jewels masterfully illuminates why these abuses are endemic to spying, shows that proper relationships are vital to control of intelligence, and advocates a system for handling &#x201c;Family Jewels&#x201d; crises in a democratic society.</p><p>John Prados is a senior fellow of the National Security Archive in Washington, DC, where he helps bring newly declassified government records to public attention. He is the award-winning author of twenty-one books, including Islands of Destiny: The Solomons Campaign and the Eclipse of the Rising Sun. He also lectures widely on security, freedom of information, and other issues; analyzes combat processes; serves as a historical adviser to filmmakers; and designs strategy board games, including the well-known Third Reich and other award-winning titles."A scholarly book about the dirty operations of the American government that feels like it has been ripped from the headlines...The book is part of the publisher's Discovering America series, which is based on the premise that much of the American experience remains to be told by historians and cultural critics with fresh takes on events and individuals seemingly well-known but often masked...Prados takes readers inside not only the CIA in an attempt to plumb the thinking behind the questionable secretive operations, but also the White House, the halls of Congress and newsrooms. As a result, he casts light on shadowy cultures that often undermine democracy. An impressive research effort showing how, when it comes to current political affairs, the past is almost always prologue." (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2013-07-15)<br><br>"Prados writes with obvious passion, and his topic couldn't be more important or timely." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"The Family Jewelsis a nice complement to any general academic or law school library&#x2019;s national security collection, and can serve as inspiration for larger research projects" (<i>Law Library Journal</i> 2014-06-14)</p><h2>A Common Word: Muslims and Christians on Loving God and Neighbor</h2><p>In late 2007 Muslim leaders from around the world together issued in the pages of The New York Times an open letter to Christian leaders inviting cooperation as a step toward peace. That letter, &#x201c;A Common Word between Us and You,&#x201d; acknowledged real differences between the two faiths but nonetheless contended that &#x201c;righteousness and good works&#x201d; should be the only areas in which they compete. The 138 signatories included over a dozen grand muftis, an ayatollah, and a Jordanian prince, and the document was widely considered a groundbreaking step toward reconciliation between Islam and Christianity &#x2015; two major religions with a great deal in common. / That original letter and a collaborative Christian response &#x2015; &#x201c;Loving God and Neighbor Together&#x201d; &#x2015; both appear in this remarkable volume. Building on those original momentous documents, A Common Word further includes subsequent commentary and dialogue between Muslim and Christian scholars addressing critical and frequently asked questions. All in all, this eventful book encapsulates a brave and encouraging move toward harmony and accord between two world religions so often seen to be at odds.</p><p>Miroslav Volf is Director of the Yale Center for Faith andCulture and Henry B.

A. Pike in Detective Fiction: The Collector&#39;s Guide described the extraordinary novels and short stories of Helen McCloy (1904-1993). Beginning with Dance of Death (1938), her first novel about psychiatrist-detective Dr. Basil Willing, McCloy experimented with daringly imaginative concepts within the framework of the formal, fairplay detective story. Her short stories, for example, include &#34;The Singing Diamonds,&#34; which combines death, detection, and apparently genuine sightings of flying saucers (in the shape of diamonds), and in her classic &#34;Through a Glass, Darkly,&#34; McCloy deals with the issue of the doppelganger or the unknown double that we all (supposedly) have.</p><p>Helen Worrell Clarkson McCloy (1904-1994)Born in New York City, Helen McCloy was educated in Brooklyn, at the Quaker Friends' school, and later studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. From 1927-1932 she worked for Hearst's Universal News Service after which she freelanced as an art critic and contributor to various publications, including the London Morning Post. Shortly after her return to the US she published her first novel, Dance of Death, in 1933, featuring her popular series detective-psychologist Basil Willing. The novel Through a Glass Darkly, a puzzle in the supernatural tradition of John Dickson Carr, is the eighth in the Basil Willing series and is generally acknowledged to be her masterpiece. In 1946 McCloy married fellow author Davis Dresser, famed for his Mike Shayne novels. Together they founded Halliday &amp; McCloy literary agency as well as the Torquil Publishing Company. The couple had one daughter, Chloe, and their marriage ended in 1961. In 1950 Helen McCloy became the first woman president of the Mystery Writers of America and in 1953 she was awarded an Edgar by the same organisation for her criticism. In 1987, critic and mystery writer H. R. F. Keating included her Basil Willing title Mr Splitfoot in a list of the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published.Detective fiction is the literature of ingenuity, and no one proves that more than cunningly clever mystery writer Helen McCloy. -- <i>Bill Ruehlmann, Norfolk Virginian-Pilot, November 30, 2003</i><br><br>One of the greatest American classicists, with a devotion to fair play comparable to Christie, Queen, and Carr.

O awaken in a still, delicious room, with the summer morning sun shine breaking softly into it through leafy greenness, was a delightful thing to Miss Fox-Seton, who was accustomed to opening her eyes upon four walls covered with cheap paper, to the sound of outside hammerings, and the rattle and heavy roll of wheels. In a building at the back of her bed-sitting-room there lived a man whose occupation, beginning early in the morning, involved banging of a persistent nature. She awakened to her first day at Mallowe, stretching herself luxuriously, with the smile of a child. She was so thankful for the softness of her lavender-fragrant bed, and so delighted with the lovely freshness of her chintz-hung room. As she lay upon her pillow, she could see the boughs of the trees, and hear the chatter of darting starlings. When her morning tea was brought, it seemed like nectar to her. She was a perfectly healthy woman, with a palate as unspoiled as that of a six-year-old child in the nursery. Her enjoyment of all things was so normal as to be in her day and time an absolute abnormality. She rose and dressed at once, eager for the open air and sunshine. She was out upon the lawn before any one else but the Borzoi, which rose from beneath a tree and came with stately walk toward her. The air was exquisite, the broad, beautiful stretch of view lay warm in the sun, the masses of flowers on the herbaceous borders showed leaves and flower-cups adorned with glittering drops of dew. She walked across the spacious sweep of short-cropped sod, and gazed enraptured at the country spread out below. She could have kissed the soft white sheep dotting the fields and lying in gentle, huddled groups under the trees. &#34;The darlings!&#34; she said, in a little, effusive outburst. She talked to the dog and fondled hi...</p><p>Frances Hodgson Barnett was born in 1849 in Manchester, England and in died in 1924 in Plandome, New York.

The artillery found it necessary to mechanise some of its field pieces. Armoured cars were called upon to carry out tasks in addition to reonnaissance. Tank destroyers were designed to seek, and destroy enemy armour. Add to this fascinating array such oddities as spedy oversnow Aerosans (armoured, fast sledges) deployed by the Red Army, to enormous siege guns weighing over 100 tons, to small remotely controlled and tracked demolition vehicles, only six feet in length, to the massive and powerfully equipped armoured trains deployed by the Soviet Union and Germany.</p><p>This comprehensive guide to military history throughout the ages is suresly a must for military history enthusiasts everywhere.It has detailed historical development of armoured fighting vehicles &amp; SPG of individual countries in World War Two. Ranges from the most primitive design of small armoured cars to advanced armoured command cars by end of war.

Jean-Baptiste Poncet, young apothecary/physician to the pashas of Cairo, is the hero of this romantic epic embroidering upon the known details of that long-forgotten embassy. Selected by the French consul to lead the mission. Poncet travels through the deserts of Egypt and the mountains of Abyssinia to the court of the Negus, thence to Versailles and back again. Along the way he falls madly in love with the consul's daughter, treats the Negus for a mysterious skin ailment, and gains a disastrous audience with the king of France.</p><p>At the heart of Jean-Christophe Rufin's marvelous first novel is a nugget of truth: in the year 1699, Louis XIV of France sent an embassy to the King of Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia). From this small fact Rufin has spun a mesmerizing tale of adventure, romance, and political intrigue that is one part Alexandre Dumas and two parts Rafael Sabatini, with just a dash of Brian Moore thrown in for good measure.<p> The hero of this epic tale is Jean-Baptiste Poncet, a young French doctor who has been practicing medicine without a license in Cairo. Poncet first comes to the notice of the authorities when the French consul in Egypt receives a secret message from a Jesuit priest commanding him in Louis's name to send a diplomatic mission to the king of Abyssinia. Foreigners--especially Christians--have not been welcome in that country since the Jesuits were expelled 50 years before, and a regular delegation would almost certainly be killed. When the consul, Monsieur de Maillet, hears that the Abyssinian monarch requires a doctor, however, he devises a plan to send Poncet both to cure and to convince the king to send a return delegation to Versailles.</p><p> Poncet has his own reasons for agreeing to go on this perilous mission: he has fallen in love with de Maillet's beautiful daughter, Alix. Unfortunately, he knows that "within the Frankish colony in Cairo, he was nothing more--whatever pains he took to hide his ancestry--than the son of a servant girl and an unknown man." The only hope he has of gaining the consul's blessing is to win Louis XIV's favor; bringing an Abyssinian embassy to Versailles might just do the trick. Poncet starts out for self-serving reasons; upon meeting King Negus, however, he comes to admire him, and soon finds himself jeopardizing his own future in order to thwart the political intrigues of his countrymen.</p><p> Rufin tells this larger-than-life tale with wit, sophistication, and a wholehearted enjoyment that shines through every sentence of this beautifully translated novel. Jean-Baptiste Poncet, a young man who "had been offered every opportunity for sadness and despair, yet ... had decided long ago that he would never succumb to such feelings," is a hero with heart, intelligence, and charm, and the book's many secondary characters are equally well developed. All in all, <i>The Abyssinian</i> marks a delightful literary debut. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Jean-Christophe Rufin is a founder of Doctors without Borders and author of the prize-winning first novel The Abyssinian.

The Bf 109G was mainly distinguished from its predecessor by the fact that it incorporated the Daimler Benz DB 605 A engine, a powerplant with a takeoff rating of 1,475 hp, 125 hp more than the DB 601E engine in the Bf 109F-4. Production of the Bf 109G was also undertaken by Germany&#x2019;s allies, including Romania and Hungary. No reliable manufacturing statistics survive, but it is estimated that 23,000 Gustavs were built by the end of the war. This volume recounts the stories of the numerous versions of the versatile Gustav, including the G-1 and G-5 with their pressurized cabins; the prolific G-2 and G-4, which saw extensive service on the Eastern Front and in North Africa; the G-6, which was built in greater numbers than any other Gustav; the short-range reconnaissance G-8; and others.

She lives in Hatfield, Massachusetts, and St. Andrews, Scotland.<p>Gr 2-4-Young Louisa's curiosity is piqued when the formidable Miss Sophy Smith drives by in her carriage and the boys with whom she is playing refer to its occupant as the "Old Dragon." When Louisa repeats the boys' appellation for this pillar of Hatfield society, the girl's mother sends her off to her room without lunch. After being liberated from her confinement, Louisa sets off to determine who or what this old dragon has to do with the elderly woman. She, of course, begins at the source. Rather than resenting the intrusion of this curious, perplexed child into her fine home, Miss Sophy is charmed by Louisa's direct manner. The two have tea and conversation despite the woman's limited hearing. Louisa plays her new friend's grand piano on her first visit and returns frequently to do so until, to her great disappointment, the child's family moves. The illustrations are executed in oil with an American folk-art flavor consistent with the period in which the story is set. Although somewhat static, the attractive paintings do give a sense of life in a 19th-century New England town.

If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books." Includes an illuminating afterword by Joyce Carol Oates.A collection of literature anthologies and reference books for Key Stage 3 onwards.</p><h2>Backyard Birds (Peterson Field Guides for Young Naturalists)</h2><p>This new series is designed with the beginner in mind. Featuring the original art of celebrated naturalist Roger Tory Peterson; incorporating the Peterson Identification System, the most effective method for bird identification; and using a straightforward design. This series makes field guides accessible and appealing to children. Roger Tory Peterson was the inventor of the modern field guide. Known as the father of modern bird watching, he has been called &#34;the greatest conservationist who ever walked this planet&#34; (ornithologist Chandler S. Robbins). More than anyone else in the twentieth century, his work as an artist, photographer, writer, editor, educator, and conservationist has increased environmental awareness and helped millions to understand and enjoy the natural world. For his work, Dr. Peterson received every major award in the field of conservation; twenty-three honorary degrees from major universities; and the United States&#39; highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal o</p><p>Roger Tory Peterson, one of the world&#39;s greatest naturalists, received every major award for ornithology, natural science, and conservation as well as numerous honorary degrees, medals, and citations, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The Peterson Identification System has been called the greatest invention since binoculars. These editions include updated material by Michael O&#39;Brien, Paul Lehman, Bill Thompson III, Michael DiGiorgio, Larry Rosche, and Jeffrey A. Gordon.From the new series "Peterson Field Guides for Young Naturalists," Backyard Birds is a wonderful handbook for the novice birder. Whether your young bird-watcher is a curious casual observer or a more systematic collector of sightings, he or she will find this guide informative and easy to follow. Featuring illustrations by the famous naturalist Roger Tory Peterson, the book gives a simple, nonthreatening introduction to the Peterson system of bird identification (essentially a set of drawings and questions that help birders look for particular identifying features). There is enough information here to help readers identify 20 backyard birds common to most parts of the U.S. and Canada. A short course on the Peterson method encourages readers to observe the size, shape, color and markings of each bird sighted, as well as its habitat, call and behavior. Armed with this information, the reader can then solve the puzzle of what is flying around in the backyard. Each chapter--as highlighted in the table of contents--shows birds of one predominant color, enabling the reader to turn to the right section and begin the identification process right away, regardless of previous bird knowledge. The chapters themselves each describe and picture one to four birds, including notes on each one's habitat, voice and food. Readers are advised to observe other identification clues such as the shape of the beak (curved or straight?), the length of the legs (long or short?), and the shape of the tail (rounded, pointed, flat or forked?). These can be difficult to note when the bird is far away or in motion, but it gets easier with practice. This book will have you paying more attention to and getting more pleasure from the birds you see every day, whether you are just out with the family or going on a walk specifically to look for birds. And there are bonus features that make the book even more useful: in the hardback version, the inside back cover of the dust jacket is printed with rulers (metric and English) that make it easier to judge a bird's size. And the index includes room for entries describing where and when the young birder has seen each species--perhaps the start of his or her life list of birds seen. <p><i>Joan Silberlicht Epstein</i></p></p><h2>The Death Artist</h2><p>A thrilling collection of twelve stories, filled with the author&#39;s trademark terror and suspense, plunges readers into a nightmare world of the cursed and the damned where nothing is what it seems. Reprint.</p><p>Dennis Etchison is a three-time winner of both the British Fantasy and World Fantasy Awards. His collections include The Dark Country, Red Dreams, The Blood Kiss, The Death Artist, Talking in the Dark, Fine Cuts, Got To Kill Them All &amp; Other Stories, A Little Black Book of Horror Tales and It Only Comes Out At Night &amp; Other Stories. He is also the author of the novels Darkside, Shadowman, California Gothic, Double Edge, The Fog, Halloween II &amp; III and Videodrome, the editor of Cutting Edge, Masters of Darkness I-III, MetaHorror, The Museum of Horrors and (with Ramsey Campbell and Jack Dann) Gathering the Bones. Etchison has written extensively for film, television and radio, including 150+ scripts for The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas. He served as President of the HWA from 1992 to 1994.HThis collection of a dozen short stories explores the disturbingDand usually urban, Southern CalifornianDterrain of what really scares us: not serial killers and vampires, but loss of identity, the inability to cope with loss, the haunting turns life can take, loneliness, manipulation, the thin line between sanity and whatever lies beyond. In sparse, subtle prose, Etchison (The Dark Country, etc.) spins these tales efficiently, surrealisticallyDand concludes them the moment just before things get truly frightening. In one story, "When They Gave Us Memory," an actor, caught in the perfection of his role, discovers the importance of memory. In "The Detailer," a happy soul discovers the depths of human depravity while cleaning a car. In "The Dead Cop," a confused man and his wife try hazily to cope with sorrow and urban violence. "Inside the Cackle Factory" explains, chillingly, what happens to good television shows and why we never see them. Populated by ordinary people who have conversations like the ones you overhear every day and set in familiar places, these stories are not only completely believable, but they're all the more disturbing because they twist and distort the dimensions of the utterly familiar. (The manipulated photographic images by J.K. Potter illustrating the book complement this skewed version of reality.) Exquisitely well written and stunningly original, these stories serve as fine examples of the ever-evolving literature of horror.

This book will both challenge Catholics and fill them with the hope that God s mercy endures forever.

Furthermore, as the grandson of immigrants, the son of a car salesman, and someone who worked his way up from earning minimum wage to running an international business, he has a first-hand view of how America's exceptional capitalist spirit can lift everyone to success.<br>In 2016, the American people faced a stark choice between two very different presidential candidates. Hillary Clinton spent most of her adult life involved in politics and promised to uphold and advance the progressive legacy of President Barack Obama who had first won the White House on promises to "spread the wealth around." Donald Trump, on the other hand, came from the business world, was an unapologetic capitalist, used his own personal wealth as inspiration, and promised simply to "Make America Great Again."<br>By choosing Trump over Clinton, the American people put a stop to decades of government expansion under progressive leadership, and they might just have saved our economy by doing so. <br>America was once a land where everyone was encouraged to seek their fortune - the more prosperous our citizens, the more our whole society could in turn prosper. But leftist forces in the United States have been seeking to tarnish the pursuit of prosperity and to paint profit as an evil motivation fit only for greedy plutocrats. Andrew Puzder understands this first-hand after a progressive smear campaign stopped him from joining President Trump's cabinet. As Puzder explains in his new book, <i>The Capitalist Comeback</i>, this was an act of desperation from a left wing facing irrelevance with a pro-business president in the White House. From its roots in the Progressive Era to labor unions to education to entertainment to its political resurgence with avowed socialist candidates such as Bernie Sanders, Puzder traces the development of the anti-profit forces in the United States and shows how, under President Trump, they can be vanquished for good.</p><p>ANDREW PUZDER is the former chief executive of CKE Restaurants, where he helped turn Hardee&#39;s and Carl&#39;s Jr. into the fast food powerhouses that they are today. Starting as the owner&#39;s personal attorney in 1991, Puzder helped pull the company out of serious financial difficulties. Under his leadership, CKE has expanded to 3,700 restaurants globally."<i>The Capitalist Comeback</i> gives a vociferous and much-needed moral, philosophical, and economic defense of capitalism, which is under siege by a variety of left-wing interest groups. While the Trump Administration has rolled back some of the overregulation and overtaxation that prevents ordinary people from becoming extraordinary, only widespread recognition of capitalism's role in creating opportunity for everyone-especially those who need it most-will ensure America's continued success in the 21st century and beyond. Given his decades of leadership in the private sector and being on the receiving end of an ugly, coordinated left-wing attack, Andy Puzder understands this fight better than anyone and is the perfect messenger to deliver this vital message."&#x2015;<b><i>Bernie Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot</i></b><br><br> "Before he was one of America's most successful restaurant CEOs, Andy Puzder earned an hourly wage working his way through school while raising a family. This makes his insights all the more important. Free market capitalism benefits everyone-worker and owner alike. <i>The Capitalist Comeback</i> is a much-needed antidote to the socialism of the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren Left."&#x2015;<b><i>Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House</i></b><br><br> "Free enterprise built America and continues to make us the strongest nation in the world. Yet the policy prescriptions of the progressive Left attack the free enterprise system, and socialism is increasingly popular on college campuses. Andy Puzder is an ardent and articulate champion of American capitalism. His moral case for free enterprise and insight into the history of American capitalism should be warmly welcomed and are desperately needed."&#x2015;<b><i>Carly Fiorina</i></b><br><br> "I've known Andy Puzder for decades, and he is a man who's talked the talk AND walked the walk. This book is a robust endorsement of capitalism written by the consummate capitalist, and it holds the key to understanding how to make the most of the Trump moment."&#x2015;<b><i>Arthur B. Laffer, Ph.D.</i></b><br><br> "Hooray! Capitalism and free markets are making a big comeback in America under Donald Trump. Andy Puzder, a chief advisor to Trump during the campaign, explains how and why it's working. Finally, a book about America with a happy ending."&#x2015;<b><i>Stephen Moore, senior economic advisor to the Trump campaign and Heritage Foundation economist.</i></b><br><br>"Great book.... <i>Capitalist Comeback</i> will be a big hit!"&#x2015;<b><i>President Donald Trump</i></b><br><br>"Puzder is exactly the kind of businessman politicians should listen to but don't. We ignore him at our economic peril."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Federalist</i></i></b><br><br>"A sweeping historical view of capitalism - and of the opposition to it, ranging from the left's "war on profit" following the Gilded Age and the rise of labor unions to modern progressives' vilification of business and their rejection of the views of moderate Democratic Party leaders such a John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton."&#x2015;<b><i>Ed Conard, RealClearPolitics</i></b><br><br>"In the introduction to his book, Puzder says that one of his primary goals in writing it was to create a "'Most Wanted' list of the institutions standing in the way of freedom and prosperity" in America so that those who value capitalism and free enterprise can better understand the forces that are fighting to obstruct Trump's economic agenda. And in that respect, <i>The Capitalist Comeback</i> succeeds pretty brilliantly."&#x2015;<b><i>Townhall.com</i></b><br><br>"Such a fantastic book.

Drawing on his intimate knowledge of a classic but rapidly changing region, Michael Edwards takes a radically different approach in this unrivaled, <i>terroir</i>-based guide to the world&#x2019;s best sparkling wines. Ninety in-depth profiles of the best small growers as well as the greatest houses are organized geographically&#x2015;from the finest producers of the great city of Reims, wine towns of Epernay and A�, and the leading villages of the Marne, and to the rising stars of the Aube (C�te des Bar) and beyond. Edwards also discusses the culture of Champagne, reviews trends in viticulture and winemaking, and investigates controversial solutions to the current crisis of success in a region that cannot satisfy global demand for its wines. Additional sections explore the gastronomic traditions of the area, give advice on pairing Champagne with food, survey the vintages of the past 20 years, list the wines with the best price-to-quality ratio, and more, making this extensively illustrated work a true connoisseur&#x2019;s guide to the most glamorous and perhaps the most enigmatic of French wines.</p><p><b>Michael Edwards</b> is a writer specializing in Champagne and gastronomy.

With this handbook--swimming with underwater accoutrements, including an attractive lucky-fish-charm bracelet, a pretty pearl ring, shiny earrings, and sparkly starfish hair decorations--secret mermaids (disguised as human little girls) can adorn themselves most mermaidily. This glamorous jewelry, when removed from sea storage and combined with the pink shell bikini top, makes for quite an ichthyological impression! Fishy fashion aside, the actual book is charming as well. Everyone experiences the occasional bout of stage fright--even someone as talented and lovely as Pearl, the little mermaid who has been invited to sing at the Fish King's birthday concert. Luckily, she has Lobster, the best music teacher in the whole kingdom, and Dolphin, a dear finned friend who provides her with companionship to ease her nerves. In the hours leading up to the concert Pearl is showered with gifts from marine chums (the tropical trimmings above). A fortune fish is provided to predict Pearl's success or failure, but with friends (and an outfit) like this, it's clear that the red-haired siren's song won't miss.

This November of 1868 it had been bitterly cold, the kind of chill that creeps into one&#x2019;s bones and makes them ache. Now it was early December and warm again. People were predicting the mild spell would last. Here in London there might not even be any snow! Most unseasonal.<br><br>Claudine regarded her face in the glass, not because she admired it, but because she must do the best with it that she could. She had never been pretty, and now in middle age she had not even the bloom of earlier years. She had strength, something not always admired in a woman; and character, also not necessarily cared for; but excellent hair, thick, shining, and with a natural wave. When her maid dressed it in a glamorous style, as she had this evening, it always stayed exactly where she wished. It was the one aspect of her appearance in which her husband, Wallace, had ever expressed his pleasure.<br><br>Not that that mattered to her anymore. He disapproved of too much that was at the core of her, like answering honestly when she was asked her political opinions&#x2014;�which were definitely more radical than most people&#x2019;s. She laughed at the jokes it would have been more ladylike to pretend not to understand. And, despite Wallace&#x2019;s disapproval, she worked at Hester Monk&#x2019;s clinic for sick or injured prostitutes&#x2014;�voluntarily, of course; she had no need of money, and the clinic had none to offer. She had begun there looking for something better to fill her time with than endless committees. Now she loved it for the fellowship, the variety, and above all, the sense that she was doing something of genuine worth.<br><br>She looked away from the glass. There was nothing more to accomplish here. She stood up and, thanking her maid, went out onto the landing and down the stairs, walking carefully so as not to trip over the hem of her rich teal-�green gown.<br><br>Wallace was standing in the hall with his coat on. He was a big man, more overweight than his expensive and skillfully cut suits allowed to show. The flicker of impatience on his heavy features told her that she had kept him waiting.<br><br>He made no remark, no compliment on her appearance, simply held her cape for her and then nodded to the footman as he followed her out of the front door. Their carriage had drawn up to the curb ready for them. The coachman must have known the address to which they were going because Wallace did not offer him any directions.<br><br>They did not speak on the journey. They had long ago run out of things to say to each other about life or feelings, and Claudine imagined he did not want to pretend any more than she did. There would be enough of that when they arrived. The other guests were all socially important, which was the reason for their going. Wallace was a successful investment adviser to several people of considerable importance, and she admitted that he deserved his success. Apart from being gifted, he worked very hard at cultivating all the right connections. He never failed in anything he regarded as his duty. It was the laughter, the gentleness, and the imagination he could not manage. Perhaps it was beyond his ability, as well as his nature. During rare moments, she hoped he was happier in their life than he had ever made her.<br><br>And yet, it would be graceless not to acknowledge that she had never gone without any of the physical comforts of life. She had never dreaded that a letter or a knock on the door would be a request to pay a debt she could not meet. He had never lied to her, so far as she was aware, never drank too much, never embarrassed her in public, and certainly had never been unfaithful. She sometimes thought she might have understood if he had been, possibly even forgiven him for it. It would have shown a quality of passion she had never felt him to possess. Instead of admiring his rigid tidiness, it infuriated her. He folded everything, even the discarded newspaper, matching the corners exactly. He put everything away where it belonged as soon as he finished using it.<br><br>But that was a self-�defeating argument. If he had understood passion and loneliness, the same desperate hunger for warmth, then she might have loved him, despite everything else. She had tried to love him. But here they were.<br><br>At least she could behave with gratitude. She would do her part this evening: She would be gracious to the Foxleys and the Crostwicks, the Halversgates and the Giffords, and everyone else it was necessary to please.<br><br>They alighted at the entrance to the Giffords&#x2019; magnificent house. Forbes and Oona Gifford were wealthy enough to entertain in the most lavish style, and seating thirty to dinner was no effort to their staff. Claudine and Wallace were welcomed into the hall, relieved of their outer clothing, and shown into the first of the large reception rooms. They had timed it perfectly: not the last to arrive, which would be slightly ill-�mannered or self-�important, but very far from first, which made one appear overeager.<br><br>Oona was Forbes&#x2019;s second wife, his first having died some ten years earlier. No one knew where Oona had lived before their marriage, and she never mentioned it, which was an interesting omission. She was very striking to look at, some might say truly beautiful. She came toward Wallace and Claudine now, her dark hair swept up luxuriantly and her slender gown the height of fashion. Wide crinolines were suddenly out. No one with the slightest pretensions to style would be seen in one.<br><br>&#x201c;Delightful of you to come,&#x201d; Oona said with a smile. &#x201c;Thank you, so much. In spite of the clemency of the weather, Christmas will be upon us before we know it. Let us begin to celebrate as soon as we can, I say.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Wallace agreed, forcing a warmth Claudine knew he did not mean. &#x201c;What better way to begin the season?&#x201d; He spotted Nigel Halversgate and moved toward him, realizing Nigel was standing with his wife, Charlotte&#x2014;�known as Tolly&#x2014;�only when it was too late to change course.<br><br>Oona saw what had happened and shot a surprisingly candid look of amusement at Claudine.<br><br>&#x201c;Beginning to gain the Christmas spirit, I see,&#x201d; Oona said ambiguously.<br><br>&#x201c;Such a party is definitely the best place to do so,&#x201d; Claudine replied, equally ambiguously. She was thinking of the discipline it took to be agreeable to a number of people she did not know very well or especially care for, but she certainly would not say so aloud.<br><br>&#x201c;Goodwill to all men,&#x201d; Oona murmured under her breath. She sighed. &#x201c;And women.&#x201d; Lifting her chin a little, she turned as Euphemia Crostwick approached, a delicately blond woman whose pretty face was always at attention, looking this way and that to be sure she missed nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you know Mrs. Burroughs,&#x201d; Oona said, motioning toward Claudine.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Eppy Crostwick smiled brightly. She looked up and down at Claudine&#x2019;s dress; it was a very handsome one, but it certainly would have overwhelmed her own diminutive figure, and its dramatic coloring would have bleached her skin. &#x201c;It seems like ages since we last met,&#x201d; she added, letting the underlying meaning hang in the air.<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d; Claudine inclined her head, her good intentions already vanished. &#x201c;So much has happened. But surely it is one of the pleasures of life to be busy, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>Eppy&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;I had no idea you were . . . busy. Your charities, no doubt . . . You must tell me all about it&#x201d;&#x2014;�she waved her hand delicately&#x2014;�&#x201c;sometime.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Claudine agreed. &#x201c;I should be happy to. However, this is an evening to celebrate our own good fortune, rather than commiserate about the tragedies of others.&#x201d;<br><br>Eppy gave a sigh of relief, which was only a trifle forced. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;d love to meet some of the other people here. You know Verena Foxley, of course. Such a good-�looking boy, Creighton, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>They all looked over at the Foxleys. Claudine did agree that Creighton Foxley was handsome enough, if not quite as superb as he himself imagined&#x2014;�but then, Eppy had not really meant it to be a question. It was an opening for Claudine, who had no children herself&#x2014;�another way in which she had disappointed Wallace&#x2014;�to argue that Eppy&#x2019;s son, Cecil, was just as distinguished, in his own way. Actually, Cecil was very ordinary looking, but one did not say such things, for Cecil and Creighton were good friends. Occasionally Ernest Hal�versgate tagged along with them, half disapproving most of the time but reluctant to say so in case he found himself excluded.<br><br>Claudine took a deep breath. &#x201c;Very handsome, in a certain way,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;But there are others perhaps a little more . . . interesting to look at, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; She smiled as she said it, allowing her implication to be understood.<br><br>Eppy was satisfied. &#x201c;I do so agree. Have you heard that Lady Lyall is to be married . . . again? The woman is quite . . .&#x201d; She searched for a word.<br><br>&#x201c;Extraordinary,&#x201d; Claudine supplied. It was the perfect cover-�all word for disapproval that could never be quoted against you. Its entire meaning depended upon the expression with which you said it, the degree of uplift in the voice.<br><br>And so the early part of the evening progressed: a series of encounters with people Claudine had met on scores of other such occasions, from a world she used to be part of. But since her work in the clinic and her introduction to a different reality, it felt more alien than ever. Did she look as strange and lost as she felt? The thought occurred to her that perhaps everyone felt the same, in their own way; as if each of them were trapped in his or her own little bubble, jostling and bumping with others but never breaking through.<br><br>No, that was complete nonsense. There was Tolly Halversgate, elegant in the extreme of fashion, wearing a shade of purple-�pink no one else would get away with. She was imparting some confidence to an elderly woman Claudine knew had a title of some sort, but she could not remember what. Countess or marchioness of somewhere. Tolly was a great royalist, always looking upward.<br><br>Lambert Foxley was talking business with a couple of hearty men at least ten years older than he. Both of them nodded to emphasize a point.<br><br>A couple of girls laughed just a shade too loudly, attracting the disapproval of their mothers, and the interest of several young men.<br><br>It was all colored silk, chatter, the glitter of lights from chandeliers, and lots of laughter.<br><br>Instead of mingling her way through the crowd again, as Wallace would have expected of her, Claudine turned away and walked through a garden room. At the far side she opened the French doors onto the terrace and stepped out. It was extraordinarily pleasant: a wide paved area extending all the way to the wall bordering the street. There were flower beds&#x2014;�bare now, of course, but no doubt full of daffodils or hyacinths come spring. There were also ornamental stone tubs at different heights, giving a most agreeable variety, and several attractive holly bushes. The terrace was overlooked by the windows of at least two of the neighboring houses, but they were all dark, leaving Claudine with an agreeable sense of solitude.<br><br>It was at that exact moment she realized with a jolt that she was not actually alone. Half in the shadows between the soft glow from the Giffords&#x2019; lighted windows, there was a man standing watching her. For an instant she was frightened. Then, when she realized he could only have come from the party, since there was no other way to reach the terrace, she was merely annoyed.<br><br>&#x201c;Good evening, sir,&#x201d; she said coldly. &#x201c;I apologize if I am interrupting you. I did not see you in the shadows.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t greatly wish to be seen,&#x201d; he replied. His voice was very deep and a little slurred, and yet there was a music in it, a lilt even in those few words. &#x201c;Then I should have to make polite, inane conversation,&#x201d; he added.<br><br>She herself was not in the mood to be polite, or inane. Her eyes were becoming accustomed to the half-�light now, and she could see him more clearly. He was of average height, which meant only an inch or two taller than she. It was hard to tell his age. His heavy hair was dense black, with not a touch of gray, even at the temples, but his face was ravaged by some inner wasting. His dark eyes were ringed with what looked like bruises, and his cheeks were blotched and sunken. His features were strong, his mouth generous, but already either disease or drink had marred him.<br><br>&#x201c;That is what parties are for,&#x201d; she said, still coolly. &#x201c;Polite conversation. What were you expecting?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just one person who can see the stars,&#x201d; he replied, apparently not stung by her tone. &#x201c;And you never know where you&#x2019;ll find them.&#x201d;<br><br>She recognized the music in his voice now. He was a Welshman, probably long left the valleys but never quite forgotten them. Surprising herself, she answered him honestly.<br><br>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t, but they are more likely to be found among those who are searching than those who would get a crick in their necks if they looked upward.&#x201d; She wished at once she had not said it. It sounded more judgmental than she had intended.<br><br>He laughed. It was a sound of pure pleasure.<br><br>&#x201c;Well spoken, Mrs. . . . never mind, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. You will tell me your name and I&#x2019;ll think it doesn&#x2019;t suit. I shall call you Olwen . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She was about to object, then she realized that she liked the name better than her own. She wanted to ask him why he had chosen it, and perhaps what it meant, but that would have betrayed far too much interest.<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; she said quietly. &#x201c;And what shall I call you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dai Tregarron,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;I would say &#x2018;at your service,&#x2019; but I do little of use. Poet, philosopher, and deep drinker of life . . . and of a good deal of fine whiskey, when I can find it. And I should add, a lover of beauty, whether it be in a note of music, a sunset spilling its blood across the sky, or a beautiful woman. I am regarded as something of a blasphemer by society, and they enjoy the frisson of horror they indulge in when mentioning my name. Of course, I disagree, violently. To me, the one true blasphemy is ingratitude, calling God&#x2019;s great, rich world a thing of no value. It is of infinite value, so precious it breaks your heart, so fleeting that eternity is merely a beginning.&#x201d; His bold stare demanded she answer.</p><h2>Sin Patr�n: Stories from Argentina&#39;s Worker-Run Factories</h2><p><p>The worker-run factories of Argentina offer an inspirational example of a struggle for social change that has achieved a real victory against corporate globalization.</p><p> <b>Lavaca</b> is an Argentine editorial and activist collective. <b>Naomi Klein</b> is an award-winning journalist and author of <i>No Logo.</i><b>Avi Lewis</b> is an author and filmmaker.

Makayla is a twenty-four-year-old woman who works at the convenience store chain that&#x2019;s taken over the city. Jesse, an eighteen-year-old, genderqueer, anarchist punk lives in an abandoned IRT station in the Bronx. Their paths cross in the aftermath of the storm when they, along with others devastated by the loss of their homes, carve out a small sanctuary in an abandoned luxury condo. In an attempt to bring hope to those who feel forsaken, an unnamed, mysterious street artist begins graffitiing colorful murals along the sides of buildings. But the castaways of the storm aren&#x2019;t the only ones who find beauty in the art. When the media begins broadcasting the emergence of the murals and one appears on the building Makayla, Jesse, and their friends are living in, it is only a matter of time before those who own the building come back to claim what is theirs. <i>All City</i> is more than a novel, it&#x2019;s a foreshadowing of the world to come.</p><p><b>Alex DiFrancesco</b> has published fiction in the <i>Carolina Quarterly</i>, the <i>New Ohio Review</i>, and <i>Monkeybicycle</i>.

Painfully sensitive and sad Orville Pym is 15 years old, and this novel recounts the summer holiday after his first miserable year at public school--but as in all of Welch's work, what is most important are the details of his characters' surroundings. Welch is a Proustian writer of uncanny powers of observation who, as William S. Burroughs wrote, "makes the reader aware of the magic that is right under his eyes." Film director John Waters includes this novel as one of his "Five Books You Should Read to Live a Happy Life If Something Is Bascially the Matter with You," and writes: "Maybe there is no better novel in the world than Denton Welch's <i>In Youth Is Pleasure</i>. Just holding it in my hands, so precious, so beyond gay, so deliciously subversive, is enough to make illiteracy a worse social crime than hunger." Also included in this edition is the first U.S. publication of "I Left My Grandfather's House." This first-person account of an idyllic walking tour in the British countryside undertaken when Welch was 18 makes a fascinating companion piece to the fictionalized, though no less autobiographical, <i>In Youth Is Pleasure.</i></p><p>Denton Welch was born on 29 March 1915 in Shanghai, the youngest of three brothers. Welch was sent back to England to attend St Michael&#39;s prep school in Uckfield, and then Repton School, where his main achievements were in art. Soon after his sixteenth birthday he ran away from school. With his family&#39;s approval he enrolled at the Goldsmiths&#39; School of Art in April 1933 to study painting. He showed great promise as an artist but in June 1935, while still a student, he was knocked off his bicycle by a motorist, severely damaging his spine and kidneys; for the rest of his life he was a semi-invalid. Welch settled in Kent, in a succession of rented flats and cottages. His final home was in the village of Crouch, where his faithful friend Eric Oliver cared for him until his premature death on 30 December 1948.</p><h2>Fu Manchu: The Zayat Kiss / The Severed Fingers (Two Complete Adventures)</h2><p>108 pages.

Because I'm there. Seeing it. Touching it. Living it. </p> <p> Madison's prom was killer�literally. Now, thanks to a mysterious amulet, she's stuck on Earth: dead but not gone. She has no idea why the dark reaper who did her in was after her, but she's not about to just sit around and let fate take its course. With a little skilled light-bending, the help of a light reaper (one of the good guys . . . maybe), her cute crush, and oh yeah, her guardian angel, Madison's ready to take control of her own destiny once and for all, before it takes control of her. </p> <p> Well, if she believed in that stuff. </p></p><p><p>Kim Harrison is best known as the author of the #1&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> best selling Hollows series, but she has written more than urban fantasy and has published more than two-dozen books spanning the gamut from young adult, accelerated-science thriller, several anthologies, and has scripted two original graphic novels set in the Hollows universe. She has also published traditional fantasy under the name Dawn Cook. Kim is currently working on a new Hollows book between other, non related, urban fantasy projects.</p>Grade 7-10&#x2013;With her purple-tipped hair and Goth style, Madison didn't fit in when she was alive, and she has real problems now that she is dead. She went to the prom with popular and handsome Josh, but when she found out that her dad had arranged the fix-up, she ran off with the dangerously charming Kairos. This was a bad idea. Kairos is a dark timekeeper who needed to strike down Madison because his own time was about to run out and when he tried, she stole his amulet. This event sets off a unique adventure in which Madison is stuck somewhere between life and death. Caught up in a world of dark and light reapers, seraphs, and guardian angels, she has to fight to get the correct amulet and to reunite her body and soul so that she can live out a life cut short. The characters and their specific jobs and places in the hierarchy of heaven and earth are hard to follow, perhaps because this first book in the series is the setup for those that follow. The final chapters are by far the best as readers finally get a handle on all of the intricacies of the story and become attached to some of the characters, such as Grace, a funny and charming guardian angel who often speaks in limericks.<i>&#x2013;Jake Pettit, Thompson Valley High School, Loveland, CO</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Combining the finished literary style of an outstanding novelist with a mature knowledge of his subject, he is able to bring this great art form to life<br>in words, directly communicating his understanding, love, and enthusiasm rather than obscuring his subject in pedantry. In fact, it might almost be said that he here lets the prints speak for themselves, in a wealth of magnificent<br>illustrations and apt but unobtrusive commentary. It is only when one has finished the book that he realizes he has been conducted on a tour of three<br>centuries of art, a tour so carefully arranged as to give a deep understanding of the history and aesthetics of Japanese prints, a new appreciation of a superlative art. The book has many other unique features. So far as consonant with his aim of presenting a full survey, Mr. Michener has illustrated the book with lesser-known masterpieces rather than with those few prints that have<br>been reproduced almost ad nauseam. Unlike earlier books, this does not stop with the past century, but brings the subject completely up to date, introducing,<br>in the modern Japanese print, some of the most exciting art being created in Japanand in the worldtoday. The book also becomes a revealing account of the collecting of Japanese prints, with many valuable hints to collectors based upon the author's own experiences in gathering together one of the best print collections of recent years: it is a collecting field in which many hints<br>are needed, with prices varying from $5 to $5,000 per print, and with forgeries and doubtful attributions on every hand.</p><p></p><h2>WWIII: Darpa Alpha: A Novel</h2><p>In a bold and devastating move against the United States, terrorists have hijacked Project Darpa Alpha, classified advanced technology that can transform rifle rounds into tank crushers. The White House is stunned at the magnitude of the assault. General Douglas Freeman has already tried and failed to stop the enemy from transporting Darpa Alpha off U.S. soil. Now he&#x2019;s about to get his second&#x2013;and last&#x2013;chance.<br><br>U.S. intelligence has traced the theft to a terrifying military state-within-a-state on the Sino-Russian border. Moscow is willing to turn a blind eye to a retaliatory U.S. assault, and the president has the perfect hero&#x2013;or the perfect scapegoat&#x2013;in Freeman. With 1,400 marines on the edge of an eerie, forbidding landscape, Freeman has a career to redeem and an enemy to defeat. But the bad guys have the means and motivation to turn Freeman&#x2019;s lightning strike into an icy swamp of death&#x2013;with a terrible new world order waiting on the other side of war.</p><p>Ian Slater, a former defense officer for the Australian Joint Intelligence Bureau, is the author of the WW III and USA vs. Militia series.

He lives in Vancouver.<b><br></b>CHAPTER ONE<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Early Fall&#x2014;Dusk<br> &#x201c;SURE BEATS BINOCULARS,&#x201d; the sergeant opined softly, one hand deftly slipping another stick of odorless gum into his mouth, the other holding a four-inch-square monitor. &#x201c;Clear as crystal.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lieutenant Sammy Ramon nodded as he too watched the monitor his sergeant was holding. The live video feed of the lake&#x2019;s research facility a quarter of a mile below was coming in from the twelve-man team&#x2019;s tiny eight-inch MAV recon plane. The micro air vehicle, developed by DARPA, the U.S. Defense Department&#x2019;s Advanced Research and Projects Agency, was made up of collapsible transparent wings and tail and equipped with a Viccol video camera and laser range finder. To get a closer look at the monitor, the lieutenant, using his left hand to remove his &#x201c;Fritz&#x201d; Kevlar helmet, his right to slide his M-16 forward to his side, momentarily wiped the beaded perspiration from his drab olive-green face paint, the latter indistinguishable from the camouflage paint of his collapsible Paratrooper mountain bike nearby. For security reasons, the other eleven men in the lieutenant&#x2019;s commando squad hadn&#x2019;t been given the precise in-country coordinates of the enemy naval base below, yet each man, looking down from his hide toward the lake, knew the exact layout of the base, everything from the small data hut on the lake&#x2019;s sandy shoreline to the bigger and more vital research barge offshore.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though the MAV couldn&#x2019;t be detected by enemy radar because of its stealth-fiber, sharp-edged construction, affording it an extraordinarily small radar signature, it nevertheless gave the lieutenant a start when, for a second, it passed as a black dot across the lemon wafer of the moon that was already visible in the dusk. But any fright the momentary silhouette might have given him was ameliorated by the fact that apart from the lone civilian security guard, which the MAV&#x2019;s infrared vision had detected, there seemed to be no other visible defenses. Once again, the lieutenant had occasion to remind himself of what a fellow soldier, retired U.S. Army General Douglas Freeman, had once said on a CNN interview after 9/11, that base security, indeed security anywhere, is more often a state of mind than a reality, more an assumption than a fact.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the tiny plane circled the enemy base again, Ramon switched to watching the target through his own video-mounted M-16, which gave him a head-on view of it, a lone barge in the fading light. The ninety-foot-long, thirty-foot-wide research barge hadn&#x2019;t changed location, remaining anchored more than a hundred yards offshore from the bungalow-sized hut onshore. Intel had told the lieutenant that while this bungalow would have to be neutralized, it was the barge that contained the data they were after and which would, therefore, be the commando team&#x2019;s primary target. Neither the lieutenant, nor any of the eleven men under his command, had been told what the data were specifically, only that they would be on a disk and how the disk would be labeled. But they had been told that this data was so vital it could irrevocably tip the balance of power in favor of the United States, not only in its ongoing war against terror but also in the face of China&#x2019;s massive buildup of high-tech weaponry following the Chinese leaders&#x2019; jaw-dropping surprise at witnessing America&#x2019;s delivery of shock and awe in the two Gulf wars.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lieutenant Ramon&#x2019;s first job was to get his team into the enemy base before he could neutralize the main hut onshore and loot the barge computer&#x2019;s hard drive, as well as the disk which scientists back home could use to reverse-engineer the weapon. Intel had told Ramon the data had originally been spawned by a Russian prototype of the revolutionary technology.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ramon had told his assault team that they were to approach the naval base with as casual an air as possible&#x2014;just another case of a friendly visit from U.S. troops coming back from maneuvers during the day&#x2014;and not to give a damn about the security cameras around the research station&#x2019;s perimeter. Ramon would give a friendly howdy-do to the security guard who was looking bored out of his mind from walking up and down along the quarter-mile chain-link storm fence that enclosed the shore hut and the fifty-foot-long jetty where a small rigid inflatable boat, obviously used for transport to and from the barge, was bobbing up and down in a small chop.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each of the twelve commandos extracted his collapsible khaki DARPA-designed Paratrooper mountain bike from its canvas shoulder bag, mounted up, and pedaled off.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some were soon freewheeling and braking, but quietly, as they headed down the blacktop road toward the fence&#x2019;s gate. Sammy Ramon spoke to each man personally as he had before the mission, warning them that if he heard so much as a squeak or squeal coming from these special post-Afghanistan-designed bikes, he&#x2019;d see to it that the man responsible would be put on a charge. &#x201c;Absolutely nothing,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d intoned, &#x201c;is to go wrong.&#x201d; Pushing for perfection, the lieutenant had had them endlessly practicing extraction, snap assembly, and disassembly. To qualify, each of the eleven commandos had to be equally proficient in handling his MOLLE, as the DARPA-designed state-of-the-art Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment pack was known, and which was equipped with an ergonomically designed plastic frame capable of hauling a central rucksack plus eighteen additional pouches of DARPA-designed &#x201c;goodies,&#x201d; including everything from extra ammunition for the video-mounted, red-dot-aiming M-16s to their GPS-updated inertial navigation system and DARPA-designed MAV. Every man had to extract his bike from his shoulder pack and assemble its two folding halves in less than thirty seconds, his MOLLE in under five minutes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Using bikes instead of noisy Humvees, Ramon had explained to his team, would enhance their &#x201c;just passing by&#x201d; explanation to the security guard. After all, what could be more natural than a group of the U.S. Tenth Mountain Division&#x2019;s bicycle unit out practicing with their bikes and just waving &#x201c;hi&#x201d; to the locals in the spirit of mutual cooperation? Ramon and his team knew that what they were about to do, if all went well, was strictly against all international law, but in the war between America and terrorists, rules were frequently thrown out the window. The enemy, Intel had assured him, wouldn&#x2019;t be expecting an attack. But Sammy Ramon&#x2019;s hard experience told him that HUMINT, human intelligence, and SIGINT, signal intelligence, could be dead wrong. Look at Tony Blair and George Bush&#x2019;s search for WMDs. Intel had also told Ramon that there&#x2019;d been reports of long copper-mesh curtains having been erected inside the onshore data-receiving hut and on board the offshore barge, this being done, Intel reports had said, in order to block any extraneous radio signals that might scramble any of the critical electronic communication traffic between the hut and offshore barge while they were calibrating their equipment. All he needed, the lieutenant told his sergeant, was for the guard, a dark, swarthy man with a submachine gun slung about his shoulder, to stand still for a couple of seconds.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You got the envelope?&#x201d; asked the sergeant.<br> &nbsp;<br> The lieutenant patted his battle dress shirt pocket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m set.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As dusk faded, day easing into night, and the breeze that carried the faint smell of algae from the lake became cooler, Ramon watched the moon&#x2019;s pale light sharply silhouetting the onshore hut and the offshore barge. Now they were ten yards from the chain-link gate and the big sign that warned in six languages &#x201c;KEEP OUT.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is it,&#x201d; Ramon said softly to his sergeant as he stopped his column of eleven men, who, as they&#x2019;d rehearsed it, were doing their damnedest to look tired and disinterested, their expressions suggesting they wanted to get back to their camp rather than waste time while the lieutenant started yakking with the locals.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How you doin&#x2019;?&#x201d; Ramon asked the guard through the chain-link fence. The man, with bushy black eyebrows and deep-set brown eyes, was wearing a cheap, civilian-made security-firm uniform festooned with shoulder patches and crimson epaulettes, no doubt meant to intimidate the locals. He looked grumpy and immediately suspicious, but Ramon took no notice, as if he hadn&#x2019;t seen the man&#x2019;s unwelcoming frown. &#x201c;Hi, I&#x2019;m Lieutenant Ramon. We&#x2019;re here to see your director.&#x201d; Ramon took a letter from his pocket and held it up close to his eyes, inclining the paper in the moonlight. &#x201c;A Doctor&#x2014;&#x201d; Ramon&#x2019;s forehead creased in concentration, as if he were trying to read a name on the envelope.<br> &nbsp;<br> All he needed was a moment or two of confusion, the security guard to cease pacing up and down inside the chain-link fence. But the guard, much shorter than Ramon had first guessed, kept moving right to left behind the wire, taking no notice of the proffered letter of authorization, looking instead beyond Ramon and the sergeant at the eleven other men. He put up his hand, signaling &#x201c;stop,&#x201d; and began walking away from the fence toward the shoreline hut, at which point Ramon, heart in his mouth, called out, &#x201c;Hey, standard procedure, man. Check my ID first.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The man paused, looked back, and saw that Ramon was holding a striped ID card against the fence, a fence which Ramon knew was normally linked to motion sensors but the latter, Intel had told him, had been disengaged because of so many false alerts, set off by roaming dogs. Sometimes the alarms were tripped by falcons, which occasionally mistook the ground sensors for rodents.<br> &nbsp;<br> The guard walked back to the fence and, taking out his flashlight, peered at the striped ID card.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ramon&#x2019;s sergeant held up his ID card as well. The guard glanced from one to the other, and it was obvious to the lieutenant that the guard didn&#x2019;t recognize either but that his pride was demanding he examine the ID cards as if he knew what he was doing. Ramon hoped Intel was right about the copper shielding thwarting any communication with the barge or hut.<br> &nbsp;<br> The guard came closer to the fence and stood still, examining the cards. The sergeant shot him point-blank through a diamond-shaped space in the chain-link fence, the spit of the Heckler Koch 9 mm sidearm barely making a sound. The guard fell backward, thudding to the ground.<br> &nbsp;<br> In seconds, the tired-looking soldiers standing around with their mountain bikes were galvanized into action.<br> &nbsp;<br> Within another five seconds, Ramon, kneeling by the chain-link fence, combat gloves on, extracted what looked like the leg of a small camera&#x2019;s tripod from his MOLLE. It was a one-inch-diameter telescoping extension claw rod with three retractable fishhook talons on it that could be used in this case to hook the dead guard&#x2019;s clothing and drag him closer to the fence. There Ramon pulled out his keys, the stench of the dead guard&#x2019;s involuntarily defecation heavy in the air.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Baku Commune, 1917-1918: Class and Nationality in the Russian Revolution (Princeton Legacy Library, 5517)</h2><p><p>The book description for the previously published "The Baku Commune, 1917-1918: Class and Nationality in the Russian Revolution" is not yet available.</p></p><p></p><h2>THE QUEST FOR ULYSSES</h2><p>Few figures have inspired so many masterpieces of literature and art as Ulysses. Writers like Homer, Sophocles, Dante, Tennyson, and Joyce and artists like Primaticcio, Tibaldi, Poussin, and Rubens have presented him in every period of creative art. Sometimes he appears as an admirable hero, sometimes as a cunning rogue. His image arouses our interest and challenges conventional ideas about what constitutes heroism and villainy. The Quest for Ulysses tries to determine the truth about this fascinating personality. It explores the world of fact and the world of imagination. The first two chapters give the background to the Ulysses legend, comparing Homer&#39;s narrative with the accounts in the Epic Cycle. The first four chapters examine what is now known about Greece and her neighbors in the early ages when the Trojan War was fought and won with the help of Ulysses. Every year, new archaeological discoveries add to our knowledge of Ulysses and his historical background. With this new archaeological evidence of the art, life, and language of the Mycenaean Age, The Quest for Ulysses embarks on the historical and archaeological part of the quest. The rest of the book considers the large store of mythology, literature, and art in which Ulysses plays a major role.</p><p></p><h2>Ranma 1/2, Vol. 9</h2><p>Follows the adventures of half-boy, half-girl martial artist Ranma, whose transforming gender problems began at the Accursed Springs in China when he became cursed to turn into a girl when splashed with cold water, and back into a boy with hot water.</p><p>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi's career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan's annual New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens.

His own life story has a similar mysterious ring to it. When Collins died in 1899 he shocked Victorians by dividing his estate equally between two mistresses. He also acknowledged the three children of one of the mistresses as his own. In <i>The Secret Life of Wilkie Collins</i>, William Clarke has pieced together the truth behind this m�nage � trois, uncovering and exploring, with insight and sympathy, the private relationships of a fascinating writer who was a contemporary of Dickens, Constable, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Blake, and Rossetti. "A literary coup ... casts a fresh beam of light on the great, dark seam of Victorian sexual mores."&#x2014;<i>The Observer</i>. "A fascinating insight into the personality of an eminent Victorian and a scholarly footnote to the social history of the Victorian literary world."&#x2014;<i>Punch</i>.

January 15, 1919, started off as a normal day in Boston&#x2019;s North End. Workers took a break for lunch, children played in the park, trains made trips between North and South Stations. Then all of a sudden a large tank of molasses exploded, sending shards of metal hundreds of feet away, collapsing buildings, and coating the harborfront community with a thick layer of sticky-sweet sludge. Deborah Kops takes the reader through this bizarre and relatively unknown disaster, including the cleanup and court proceedings that followed. What happened? Why did the tank explode? Many people died or were injured in the accident&#x2014;who was to blame? Kops focuses on several individuals involved in the events of that day, creating a more personal look at this terrible tragedy.</p><p>Deborah Kops is the author of more than a dozen nonfiction children&#x2019;s books, including ZACHARY TAYLOR: AMERICA'S 12TH PRESIDENT, SCHOLASTIC KID'S ALMANAC, and her Wild Birds of Prey series. She lives in Westford, Massachusetts.Imagine a 40-foot wall of molasses turning a harborside neighborhood upside down. It was a hopeful time in Boston. The worst of the Spanish influenza was over, World War I had just ended and Babe Ruth had helped the Red Sox win the World Series the previous fall. But on January 15, 1919, in Boston's North End, on a sunny, warm day, the molasses tank in the neighborhood blew. More than 2,300,000 gallons of molasses, weighing 13,000 tons, flowed down the street, uplifting houses, twisting railroad tracks and killing 21 people. Fallen elevated train tracks, dead horses, collapsed buildings and crushed cars made the areas look as though a tornado had come through. The smell of molasses in the neighborhood didn't fade until 1995, though the memory of the event has. Using firsthand testimony from the 40-volume transcript from <i>Dorr v. U.S. Industrial Alcohol</i>, the hearings that followed the event, Kops has done a fine job of resurrecting the story and recreating the day through third-person stories of the actual players. Had she retained some of the first-person accounts, she may have lent her narrative greater immediacy, but it is nevertheless an intriguing read. A useful map, abundant archival photographs and sidebars offering historical context complement the lively prose. A fascinating account of a truly bizarre disaster. --Kirkus Reviews<br><br>This book chronicles the catastrophic events resulting from the collapse of a large tank containing molasses in the North End neighborhood of Boston in 1919.

Franz Kafka (1883-1924) was a Czech-born German-speaking insurance clerk who despised his job, preferring to spend his time writing. Nevertheless, Kafka published little during his lifetime, and ordered his closest friend to burn the mass of unpublished manuscripts, now familiar to us as some of the most influential novels and short stories of the twentieth century, after his death. Kafka&#39;s novels, all published posthumously, include The Trial, The Castle, and Amerika.

Should they follow a traditional, demonstrably administrative, approach to pastoral care, emphasizing doctrinal instruction, the care of the poor, and the celebration of the sacraments? Or should they bring to the parish the ascetic models of spiritual direction, characterized by a more personal spiritual father/spiritual disciple relationship? <i>Five Models of Spiritual Direction in the Early Church</i> explores the struggles of five clerics (Athanasius, Gregory Nazianzen, Augustine of Hippo, John Cassian, and Pope Gregory I) to reconcile their ascetic idealism with the reality of pastoral responsibility. Through a close reading of Greek and Latin texts, George E. Demacopoulos explores each pastor's criteria for ordination, his supervision of subordinate clergy, and his methods of spiritual direction. He argues that the evolution in spiritual direction that occurred during this period reflected and informed broader developments in religious practices. Demacopoulos describes the way in which these authors shaped the medieval pastoral traditions of the East and the West. Each of the five struggled to balance the tension between his ascetic idealism and the realities of the lay church. Each offered distinct (and at times very different) solutions to that tension. The diversity among their models of spiritual direction demonstrates both the complexity of the problem and the variable nature of early Christianity. Scholars and students of late antiquity, the history of Christianity, and historical theology will find a great deal of interest in <i>Five Models of Spiritual Direction in the Early Church</i>. The book will also appeal to those who are actively engaged in Christian ministry.</p><p>"The introduction offers a masterful treatment of the growth of the ascetic movement and the growth of ecclesiastical offices, and the requirements and expectations of leadership in both contexts. It is these expectations of a leader's responsibility for those entrusted to him that show most clearly the demands of pastoral care." &#x2014;Claudia Rapp, UCLAGeorge E. Demacopoulos is the Fr. John Meyendorff &amp; Patterson Family Chair of Orthodox Christian Studies at Fordham University.

But when Navajo Police Special Investigator Ella Clah receives a mysterious package in the mail, she begins to suspect that Jimmy's death is part of something larger. </p><p>Ella finds she must use Navajo lore, not FBI cryptography, to decode Jimmy's message. Tantalizing clues link Jimmy's death to his military service&#x2015;but what could the medic have seen in Iraq that would make him a target for murder back home?</p><p>Ella's personal life seems just as complicated as her case. Her mother, Rose Destea, marries her long-time beau, Herman Cloud. Then the father of Ella's daughter, Dawn, asks for a change in custody arrangements that will reduce Ella to a weekend mother&#x2015;a much easier fit with her workload but something that will take a terrible toll on her heart.</p></p><p><p><b>Aim�e</b> and <b>David Thurlo</b> are the authors of the Ella Clah series, the Lee Nez series of Navajo vampire mysteries, and the Sister Agatha novels. Their other works include <i>Plant Them Deep</i>, a novel featuring Rose Destea, the mother of Ella Clah, and <i>The Spirit Line</i>, a young adult novel. <br> David was raised on the Navajo Reservation and taught school there until his recent retirement. Aim�e, a native of Cuba, has lived in the US for many years. They live in Corrales, New Mexico, and often make appearances at area bookstores.</p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong><br><br>In all her years serving first with the FBI, and then the Navajo Tribal Police, Special Investigator Ella Clah had never had an office with a window---until now. Of course, back in her Bureau days, she&#x2019;d never even had an office---just a desk. Progress.<br><br>Budgets had grown, not due to tribal prosperity but because of an increase in violent crimes across the Navajo Nation. That had forced an expansion of their existing station and Ella, as head of their Major Crimes Unit, had landed space in their new wing. The odor of fresh paint was a constant reminder of the changes taking place in the department as was the color scheme, a palette of soft aquas, designed to relieve stress and maximize efficiency.<br><br>Ella swiveled in her chair, took a sip of freshly brewed coffee, and gazed at Ship Rock, the rock formation that was their town&#x2019;s namesake. In actuality, the jagged rock outcropping was the eroded neck of a volcano that had formed three million years ago.<br><br>Ella recalled the old story about the huge flying monsters that had once lived there. The tale was part of every Navajo child&#x2019;s education from before the first grade---that is, if they attended reservation schools. The story was vibrant with the richness and rhythms of the Dineh, The People&#x2019;s, legends. She could almost hear her mother, Rose, telling her the tale, keeping the legends alive---a gift from one generation to the next.<br><br>The Dineh had lived in fear of the giant birds who&#x2019;d made their home on the upper levels of Ship Rock, Rose had taught her. The birds would swoop down and smash their prey against the rocks, then feed on the remains. Monster Slayer, one of the Hero Twins, was chosen to do battle with them, but when he approached their hunting ground, one of the giant birds picked him up in his talons, flew high into the skies, and dropped him, leaving him to fall on the rocks below. Expecting nothing less, Monster Slayer had prepared well and landed gently because he&#x2019;d possessed a life feather given to him by Spider Woman.<br><br>Then Monster Slayer discovered that the giant birds had young and, after he killed the male and the female, the young began to cry and plead for their lives. Monster Slayer took pity on them and, instead of killing them, he turned the older one into an eagle so he could furnish feathers for men, and the younger one into an owl so men would listen to the owl&#x2019;s voice and be able to discern the future.<br><br>Rabbit, who was below, took some feathers from the giant bird Monster Slayer had killed and stuck them in his fur. And that&#x2019;s why jackrabbits have large ears that look like giant feathers.<br><br>All the Dinetah, the land of the Navajos, was filled with stories about the ones who&#x2019;d come before. Every sandstone formation, pass or valley, mountain peak, and rock formation within the Four Corners and beyond echoed with the tradition of the Dineh.<br><br>Ella sipped her coffee. It was still early, and she refused to rush as she made up for all those years of staring at painted cinder blocks and file cabinets instead of the blue sky and drifting white clouds. The wind was calm now, as it usually was during the early morning hours, and she intended to savor this moment of peace. By noon, or maybe even before, the gusts could start again, blowing sand and dust everywhere.<br><br>Gathering her thoughts, she watched the crows hop around the parking lot outside, looking for crumbs and candy wrappers that still held a hint of flavor. Just beyond them she could see two support posts of a control gate built into the bank of the irrigation ditch. Last night some would-be comedian had slipped an old pair of khaki uniform pants onto the posts, then placed shoes on the ends. At first glance it looked like an officer was headfirst in the ditch. Everyone who&#x2019;d driven past it on the way into the station had chuckled and commented about it, so it had remained in place for the moment. Later, the conservancy people would probably come by and return it to normal.<br><br>Finished with her coffee, she turned, hearing Justine step through the doorway. &#x201c;Morning, partner,&#x201c; Ella greeted.<br><br>Justine nodded, a somber expression on her face. &#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s good about it now. Another possible carjacking went down late last night or earlier this morning. This time all hell has broken loose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;ve we got?&#x201d; Ella said, automatically reaching for her keys as she dropped the empty foam cup into the wastebasket.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a homicide too---a soldier who just returned home from Iraq. The officer at the scene ID&#x2019;d him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d he die?&#x201d; Ella grabbed her jacket, and was out the door before Justine had answered.<br><br>&#x201c;Multiple gunshot wounds, according to the officer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have a &#x2018;twenty&#x2019; on this?&#x201d; she asked referring to the location of the crime as they hurried down the hall.<br><br>&#x201c;Just off Highway 64 about three miles west of Rattlesnake,&#x201c; Justine answered. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll have to take your unit. Mine&#x2019;s getting new tires.&#x201d;<br><br>Once in the parking lot, they hurried to Ella&#x2019;s unmarked vehicle, Justine taking the keys. As they pulled up to the highway and Justine braked, checking for traffic, they both heard an ominous high-pitched squeal. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the dust from yesterday&#x2019;s wind. Smell it in the air? It&#x2019;s starting early today too. The breeze will turn into gusts before noon today for sure and sand will fly everywhere including the brake linings again,&#x201c; Ella said. &#x201c;I read in the paper that the wind&#x2019;s been getting up to sixty in the afternoons. I hate this kind of weather. Waves and waves of sand, pitting the windshield, settling into the brake lines, even drifting into the gun barrels.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t do much for your mood, does it, partner?&#x201d; Justine observed with a wry smile.<br><br>&#x201c;No, it doesn&#x2019;t. I can&#x2019;t stand the constant whistling through the slightest gap in the windows and doors, the sand blasting against your skin... not to mention evidence flying everywhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some say that Wind carries information. You just have to listen carefully,&#x201c; Justine said.<br><br>&#x201c;Now you sound like my brother. Clifford knows all the stories. It&#x2019;s part of what makes him a good medicine man. He says that Wind has supporting power---that if I tune myself in to it, rather than become its adversary, I&#x2019;d get farther. But I still hate the taste of sand in my mouth, and since Wind puts it there...&#x201d;<br><br>Justine laughed.<br><br>Ella turned down the volume of the police radio. Today, it was mostly static and garbled transmissions. Another of Wind&#x2019;s side effects on obsolete equipment. The budget increases had targeted additional staff and facilities, not equipment, unfortunately. &#x201c;What else did you get on this latest crime?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Officer Mark Lujan called it in just a few minutes before I came into your office,&#x201c; Justine answered. &#x201c;He found the body down a side road near a cattle guard. It was visible from the highway. Most of the traffic this time of day goes toward town instead of away, so apparently nobody coming into work saw it across the road. Lujan was on his way west toward Beclabito.&#x201d;<br><br>Ella nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m familiar with that stretch. It&#x2019;s pretty desolate out there past Rattlesnake. Just a few houses here and there down toward the river, and you really have to look for them. Most are earth-toned and they blend into the landscape, except for the generic red tar paper roofs.&#x201d;<br><br>They made a sweeping turn toward the northwest, and Ella looked up at Ute Mountain over in Colorado. &#x201c;What do you have on the victim?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The deceased lived on land that was allotted to his family. After his parents passed on, he and his brother leased sections of it. The victim&#x2019;s name is Jimmy Blacksheep,&#x201c; she added after a moment&#x2019;s hesitation. Although police officers, by and large, were modernists, most of them shared a reluctance to speak of the recently deceased by name. It wasn&#x2019;t so much fear of the chindi, the evil in a man that stayed earthbound after death. It had more to do with respect for the Navajo cultural practices they&#x2019;d learned and followed most of their lives. Habits of a lifetime were hard to break.<br><br>&#x201c;Officer Lujan have any help at the scene?&#x201d; Ella asked, staring at the lonely stretch of highway before them.<br><br>&#x201c;No, but he&#x2019;s doing what he can to protect the crime scene until we arrive. Lujan&#x2019;s a rookie, but he&#x2019;s good. He&#x2019;ll handle things. And it&#x2019;s not like there&#x2019;s going to be a crowd there. Most of our people will go out of their way to avoid a body,&#x201c; Justine said then added. &#x201c;Tache, Neskahi, and the M.E. should arrive at the scene shortly.&#x201d;<br><br>Ella nodded. Sergeant Joseph Neskahi and Officer Ralph Tache worked for her Special Investigations team and served as the Crime Scene Unit. Carolyn Roanhorse was a forensic pathologist, an M.D. who specialized in causes of death that related to court proceedings. Carolyn understood bullet trajectories, poisonings, and could differentiate between stab wounds and blunt injury ones. There were less than one thousand forensic pathologists in the country, but Carolyn worked exclusively for the tribe---an exception to the otherwise statewide authority of the N.M. Office of the Medical Investigators, headquartered in Albuquerque.<br><br>Carolyn had a thankless job. Since she worked with the bodies of the dead, she was virtually a pariah but, through her work, she continued to acknowledge her debt to the tribe who&#x2019;d paid for her schooling.<br><br>As they approached the scene, Ella immediately spotte...</p></p><h2>Cake Decorating: 2012 Wilton Yearbook</h2><p>The new 2012 Wilton Yearbook adds new excitement and fun to all your celebrations!

Never before, in the course of 30 years of lecturing at the University of Vienna, had he deliberately set down, with a view to publication, the full range of his theories and observations. This series, therefore, represents a stock-taking of psychoanalysis as it stood after the secession of Adler and Jung.</p><p>Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) is one of the twentieth century's greatest minds and the founder of the psychoanalytic school of psychology. His many works include The Ego and the Id; An Outline of Psycho-Analysis; Inhibitions; Symptoms and Anxiety; New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis; Civilization and Its Discontent, and others. <br> <br>Peter Gay is the author of more than twenty-five books, including the National Book Award winner The Enlightenment, the best-selling Weimar Culture, and the widely translated Freud: A Life for Our Time. He lives in New York City.In 1915 at the University of Vienna 60-year-old Sigmund Freud delivered these lectures on psychoanalysis, pointing to the interplay of unconscious and conscious forces within individual psyches. In reasoned progression he outlined core psychoanalytic concepts, such as repression, free association and libido. Sydney Walker&#39;s fast-paced delivery in a slight English accent works well. He could be Freud himself, a dynamic speaker pacing the podium, pausing with asides and checking his pocket watch to make every minute count. The listener has no sense that the text is abridged. Walker&#39;s Freud is a powerful communicator; he illuminates how Freud revolutionized our understanding of ourselves. J.H.L.

From 1959, beginning with Joan Crawford's last major film, <i>The Best of Everything</i>, and ending in 1984 with <i>Steaming</i>, Joseph Losey's final picture, she worked behind the scenes on forty films, including <i>The Misfits</i> and <i>Alien</i>, capturing such legends as Marlene Dietrich, Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren, Paul Newman, Isabella Rossellini, Marlon Brando and Anjelica Huston. </p><p><i>Film Journal</i> is a collection of these images, over 120 photographs in all, along with the notes and impressions made by Arnold during the shoots. As her camera revealed the personalities beneath the stars, Arnold also became privy to their personal lives. In <i>Film Journal</i> she writes memorably about the tensions and dramas on the film set, of Crawford sneaking in vodka in a Pepsi cooler, Dietrich recounting her night with JFK. </p><p>With eighty previously unpublished photographs and including many old favorites, <i>Film Journal</i> is a classic from one of the twentieth century's most distinguished photographers.</p></p><p><p>Born in Philadelphia into a Russian immigrant family, <b>Eve Arnold </b>studied medicine before changing to photography studies in New York in 1947. In 1951 she became the first woman to work for the celebrated Magnum Photos agency. A friend and protegee of the French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, Arnold is known equally for her photo-essays on peoples and cultures and her sensitive portraits of both celebrities and unknown subjects. Her work has appeared in <i>Life</i> magazine and <i>The Sunday Times</i>, among many others.</p>This book highlights a little-known aspect of longtime Magnum member Arnold's career: her photojournalism and publicity work on over 20 films, ranging from Joan Crawford's The Best of Everything (1959) to John Huston's Under the Volcano (1984), with a few stray celebrity shots included as a bonus. Sadly, this work has been little seen, perhaps because so many of the films covered here were box office bombs. The book captures Arnold's gift for establishing intimacy with her subjects. Most memorable is a portrait of a bone-weary Anne Bancroft on the set of The Pumpkin Eater, taken just days after President Kennedy's assassination. Arnold's reflections on the films are jottings and impressions, not fully developed essays. Still, readers may enjoy some gossipy tidbits, as when, moments after meeting Arnold, an aging, inebriated Joan Crawford insisted that she be photographed in the nude (the photographs were taken but don't appear in the book). Movie buffs will enjoy some film history photographic footnotes, like the one of a young Vanessa Redgrave accompanied by toddlers Joely and Natasha Richardson, now both respected actresses. The best shots: a young, intense, T-shirt clad Paul Newman attending a 1955 Actor's Studio class and a classic shot of film legends Montgomery Clift and Marilyn Monroe in intense concentration before a take on The Misfits. This black-and-white photo collection deserves a place on the shelves of large popular film history collections.

Schaffner has arranged choice objects according to their intended use in school, kitchen, farm, town, play, etc. A question-and-answer format allows descriptive detail, and the use of directive headings guides readers to closer examination of specific photographs, which may or may not be on the same page. The small typeface, extended text, and involved explanations of the materials and techniques used in quilting, theorem paintings, frakturs, whirligigs and other arts suggest that adults may be the most likely audience, although certainly the colorful pictures of weathervanes, cigar-store Indians, and paper dolls will interest children. A last chapter, ``Folk Art Projects,'' gives clear directions on making authentic-looking crafts. The bright images, project ideas, and list of further reading make this an appealing introduction. --Shirley Wilton, Ocean County College, Toms River, NJ<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hope &amp; Healing for Those with PTSD</h2><p>If you or a family member is struggling with a condition called posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), then this little book is for you. As a psychiatrist and research scientist for more than 30 years, I&#x2019;ve been struck by how many people with PTSD are not being treated correctly for this disorder (and why more than 50% of persons with PTSD continue to suffer disabling symptoms despite treatment). For that reason, I&#x2019;ve written this book to inform those affected by PTSD about the condition and the best whole person treatments available today. I describe here what PTSD is, the causes for it, and the factors that protect against it. I also examine a separate condition called moral injury that often accompanies PTSD and can interfere with PTSD recovery unless identified and treated at the same time. I then focus on the best evidence-based treatments for PTSD today -- psychological, medical / pharmacological, and especially, religious or spiritual. If you or a family member has PTSD or are experiencing the aftermath of severe trauma, you will know a lot more about this disabling condition and how to deal with it after reading this book.

Whatley says, matter-of-factly. &#39;I&#39;d say that one of these farms, properly run, could gross in the neighborhood of a quarter of a million dollars a year, after it comes into full production.&#39; Labor and marketing. Those are the keys. They are also the two biggest problems facing any farmer, especially small farmers. Whatley, an internationally known horticulturist from Tuskegee Institute, set out in 1974 to solve those problems. What he came up with is a 10-point plan that lets you: Build a GUARANTEED MARKET for all of your crops; Enjoy year-round, DAILY cash flow; Have full-time, year-round employment. Eliminate middlemen. The crop mix will vary from region to region, but the basics remain the same no matter where you farm. &#39;Small farmers have to concentrate on high-value crops,&#39; Whatley says. &#39;The trouble with today&#39;s average small farm is that it&#39;s nothing but a scaled-down big farm. The guy with 25 or 40 acres is doing the same thing as the big boys: planting corn, cotton and soybeans. He can&#39;t afford to! Costs are too high. Returns are way too low.&#39; Whether you&#39;re a farmer who wants to diversify crops and income sources...One of the growing number of people who want to change careers and earn a good living off a little land...Or just thinking about a small farm to keep you active and provide a comfortable retirement income...This book is for you! Whatley also explains: Where to locate your farm; What to grow; How to &#39;weatherproof&#39; your farm; How to get your customers to do much of the work; How to equip your farm, sensibly and economically. And much, much more! It is a comprehensive guide to all of the farm machinery you&#39;ll need.

The children of Italian immigrants were kidnapped, and dozens of innocent victims were gunned down. Bombs tore apart tenement buildings. Judges, senators, Rockefellers, and society matrons were threatened with gruesome deaths. The perpetrators seemed both omnipresent and invisible. Their only calling card: the symbol of a black hand. The crimes whipped up the slavering tabloid press and heated ethnic tensions to the boiling point. Standing between the American public and the Black Hand&#39;s lawlessness was Joseph Petrosino. Dubbed the &#34;Italian Sherlock Holmes,&#34; he was a famously dogged and ingenious detective, and a master of disguise. As the crimes grew ever more bizarre and the Black Hand&#39;s activities spread far beyond New York&#39;s borders, Petrosino and the all-Italian police squad he assembled raced to capture members of the secret criminal society before the country&#39;s anti-immigrant tremors exploded into catastrophe. Petrosino&#39;s quest to root out the source of the Black Hand&#39;s power would take him all the way to Sicily-but at a terrible cost. Unfolding a story rich with resonance in our own era, The Black Hand is fast-paced narrative history at its very best.</p><p>Stephan Talty is the award-winning author of Agent Garbo, Empire of Blue Water, and other best-selling works of narrative nonfiction. His books have been made into two films, the Oscar-winning Captain Phillips and Granite Mountain. He&#39;s also the author of two psychological thrillers, including the New York Times best-seller Black Irish, set in his hometown of Buffalo, NY.&#34;What a terrific read! Through incredible historical research and a detective&#39;s eye for the telling detail, Stephan Talty chronicles Joseph Petrosino&#39;s dogged pursuit of cold-blooded extortionists and killers. It&#39;s a story about immigration, urban life, and the struggle of law enforcement to confront the terror spread by a start-up criminal underworld at the turn of the 20th century&#34; -- Dick Lehr, author of the New York Times bestseller Black Mass &#34;The Black Hand is a fascinating immersion into an almost forgotten time and culture in which a mysterious criminal enterprise terrorized immigrants seeking a new life in America. Stephan Talty&#39;s book provides a richly woven, engrossing tale of one man determined to help his fellow Italian-Americans resist the threat and prosper. A solid addition to the American history library&#34; -- Gregory A. Freeman, author of The Forgotten 500 &#34;Stephan Talty is a marvelous storyteller, and with The Black Hand, he&#39;s hit a gusher: the true tale of one of New York City&#39;s greatest detectives at war with a lethal secret society and at odds with his own department. In Talty&#39;s hands, this is a thrilling instant classic.&#34; -- Robert Kolker, author of the New York Times bestseller Lost Girls &#34;Given the secret nature of the Black Hand - which terrorized New York and the nation a century ago - Talty&#39;s account is extraordinarily detailed. Even more intimate is the portrait of Petrosino, chief Mafia detective. An important and gripping book.&#34; -- A. J. Baime, author of The Arsenal of Democracy</p><h2>The Magic Wagon</h2><p>Buster Fogg, a young orphan, joins up with a medicine show known as The Magic Wagon and its two con men, Billy Bob Daniels and Old Albert</p><p>In 1986, years before he became known for his hardboiled crime thrillers, Lansdale crafted this wry, nostalgic elegy to the Wild West published in a small print run with limited distribution. A mild-mannered precursor to his brassy The Big Blow, this entertaining episodic novel is also set in turn-of-the-20th-century eastern Texas, where crooked traveling medicine shows and aging gunslingers define the closing frontier. Narrator Buster Fogg's family is wiped out by a twister in an early sequence described with surreal verve. Buster hitches on with Billy Bob Daniels, a patent-medicine pusher and trick shooter who claims to be the illegitimate son of Wild Bill Hickock, joining an entourage consisting of a kindly ex-slave named Albert, and Rot Toe, the wrestling ape. Adventures on the road which include swiping the mummified remains of Billy Bob's "pa" and swindling settlers with their concoction of watered-down whiskey stoke personal tensions that only aggravate troubles when their wagon rolls into Mud Creek and Billy Bob is called out by Texas Jack, a dime-novel desperado who, legend says, intimidated even Wild Bill. Lansdale's affection for the classic western is never in doubt, although he spends much of the novel skillfully deflating the romance of heroic reputations made as much by luck and exaggeration as by skill with a gun. The true charm of the story, though, is iin its telling, which melds laconic humor, colorful colloquialisms and outrageous figures of speech into a Twainesque tall tale. This novel endures as a modern western classic. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Letters to the Midwife: Correspondence with Jennifer Worth, the Author of Call the Midwife</h2><p>Letters to the Midwife<br>When the CALL THE MIDWIFE books became bestsellers, Jennifer Worth was inundated with correspondence.

Each of Teague&#39;s books starts as &#34;notebooks full of sketches and scribbles, strange little drawings, and phrases that seem mostly cryptic that suddenly come together,&#34; he explains. His books tackle everything from first graders coping with life on Mars to Shakespearean characters coping with life on earth. Mischievous dinosaurs, witty dogs, nightmare haircuts, messy rooms, closet monsters - all find their way into Teague&#39;s wildly inventive books. Teague has also collaborated with many critically acclaimed authors, including Jane Yolen, Audrey Wood, and Cynthia Rylant. He lives in upstate New York with his wife and two daughters. For more information about Mark Teague, visit scholastic.com/tradebooksThis latest in an early-reading series from Rylant, featuring the everyday adventures of Poppleton the pig, is as wry and supple as other entries, with the added charm of familiarity. In three stories, Poppleton's pal Cherry Sue serves as a safety net to the pig's minor misadventures. The first is a bit of nonsense involving geese flying south; Poppleton invites them in for cookies, but chatting and serving so many geese exhausts him so that he can only utter gibberish when he drops by Cherry Sue's, and succumbs to a nap. When Poppleton seeks a new winter coat, Zacko the ferret haberdasher insults the pig for his rotundity. Cherry Sue, reminding Poppleton that Zacko is a ferret, after all, with a radically different perspective on big and small, gives her friend a catalog for big and tall pigs. Lastly, Cherry Sue saves Poppleton's bacon at the Lion's Club pancake breakfast. If the prose invites a merry, humorous reading, Teague, hitting the illustrator's equivalent of a perfect stride, provides wonderful scenes that conduct beginning readers through the story.

Which was funny, considering that last night should have been one of the best nights of his life. <i>Should have been</i> were the operative words here, however. Although Ken did receive a special spirit award from the <i>Sweet Valley Tribune,</i> his father had neglected to show up for the big moment. And that had put more than a slight damper on the evening.<br><br><i>I can't believe he bailed out on me for some woman,</i> Ken thought, throwing off his plaid comforter and grabbing his gray SVH-football sweatpants from the shag-carpeted- floor. Sure, Ken understood that his father needed to date. But did that have to mean that Ken was now delegated to the very bottom of his father's priority list--somewhere below going to the dentist and cleaning out the garage?<br><br>Ken sighed. Normally he didn't tell his father when things were bothering him. It seemed too hard and too pointless to have that type of a conversation with the guy. But this time was going to be different. Ken wasn't going to let him off easy.<br><br><i>I guess I'll have to wait until this afternoon for that,</i> he thought as he walked out of his room. Ken hadn't heard his father come home last night, so he figured that he must have slept at Asha's. <i>Man. I wouldn't be surprised if he moved in with her altogether and left me here alone.</i><br><br>But as Ken headed down the staircase, he heard his father's voice, followed by a woman's laughter.<br><br>Ken stopped in place. Part of him wanted to run back up the stairs and stay in his room until she left.<br><br>But he wasn't a child, and he wasn't going to hide out in his own home.<br><br>Still, as he rounded the corner and walked into the kitchen, he sort of wished he had. It was just so...weird, seeing his father and this strange woman sitting and eating in his little breakfast nook, Asha looking perfectly at home in Ken's father's dark blue bathrobe, the <i>Sweet Valley Tribune</i> laid out before her on the square, black Formica table. And they were so busy drinking their coffee and eating their bagels that they didn't even notice Ken when he walked in. Ken's father reached out to massage Asha's slender shoulder.<br><br>"Uh, hey, guys," Ken mumbled.<br><br>Asha immediately broke away from Mr. Matthews, closing the bathrobe tighter around her body. "Morning," she said, pushing her red-framed glasses up on her face. A dark tendril of hair slipped out of the bun on top of her head, and a flush jumped to both of her cheeks. She forced a smile.<br><br>Ken's own cheeks felt like they were flaming up, which really annoyed him. She was the one who should be embarrassed, not him.<br><br>Ken's father was the only one who acted like nothing was out of the ordinary. He ran a hand through his thinning blond hair, gulped down his last drop of coffee, and said, "Morning, Ken."<br><br>Ken blinked. Was his dad even going to apologize for last night? Did he even remember?<br><br>"Would you like a bagel?" Asha asked, standing up. "Some coffee?"<br><br>Okay, this was completely screwed up. She was acting like she lived here now.<br><br>"No," Ken said, walking over to the refrigerator. "Thanks." He pulled out the orange juice, then shot another glance at his father. Nothing.<br><br>Ken put the juice container down on the counter. He couldn't take this anymore. "Dad?" he began. "Did you just completely forget about last night or what?"<br><br>Mr. Matthews looked up from the paper. His blue eyes opened wide. "Last night?" Asha put down her own bagel midbite and watched Ken's father warily.<br><br>"You know, the awards dinner?" Ken reminded him, even though he was fairly certain his dad knew exactly what he was talking about. "You promised me you'd come. I looked all over for you like an idiot."<br><br>Ken's father put down the paper, leaning forward. "Now's not the time, Ken. Let's talk about this when we're alone."<br><br><i>Now's not the time to what? Apologize?</i> Ken thought, fuming. He grabbed a glass out of the overhead cabinet and slammed it down on the counter, sloppily pouring some juice into it and almost causing the glass to overflow. "Yeah, whatever," he muttered, taking a sip.<br><br>"No, Ken, we're sorry," Asha suddenly put in, surprising both Ken and, by the looks of his expression, Ken's father.<br><br>Mr. Matthews placed a hand on Asha's wrist. "Asha, you don't have to--"<br><br>"No, no." She took off her glasses and regarded Ken with apologetic brown eyes. "We had these reservations at Le Bon Coin. A friend got them for us. They would've been a big deal to cancel."<br><br>Ken traced the rim of his glass with his finger, trying not to explode. What was with all this "we" crap? Fine, so they were going out, but since when did Asha become his father's official spokesperson? And since when was keeping a reservation at a trendy restaurant more important than showing up for your son's awards dinner? Ken deserved a <i>real</i> apology. From his father.<br><br>Ken glanced over at him now. His dad was folding the newspaper and standing up, as if everything had been neatly explained.<br><br>"You could have at least called to tell me that," Ken said.<br><br>Mr. Matthews's round cheeks tinged with pink. He rolled up the newspaper like a poster, wrapping both of his big hands around it. "Ken, Asha just apologized," he warned. "Watch your tone."<br><br><i>Yeah,</i> Ken thought, <i>that's just the problem. Asha apologized. Not you.</i><br><br>"No, Ken's right," Asha said, clearing the table. She carried the two black ceramic mugs arid plates over to where Ken was standing, then put them in the sink. "We should've called. I don't know what we were thinking." She turned to Ken, placing one hand on her hip. "I'm really sorry. It won't happen again."<br><br>All Ken could do was stare down at his glass of orange juice. But he was thinking about his mom. And how she never would have let this happen in the first place.<br><br>"I'm just used to being alone," Asha continued as she turned on the water at the sink and began to rinse off the plates and mugs. "But I know that's gotta change if I'm going to be a part of your lives. I'm going to have to start considering your feelings as well as your father's."<br><br>Ken watched Asha silently as she opened the dishwasher and loaded it up. Who was this woman? And in what way did she think she was going to be a part of Ken's life?<br><br>Asha closed the dishwasher and looked at Ken, wiping her hands dry with a dishrag. "So. Apology accepted?"<br><br>Ken fidgeted with the edge of the counter. "Uh, yeah."<br><br>Asha smiled an enormous, toothy smile. Then she leaned against the counter, crossing her arms over her chest. "Hey, you know what I'd like to do?" she asked, glancing from Ken to his father.<br><br>Ken's father tapped the rolled-up newspaper against the table. "What?"<br><br>"Make dinner for you two guys on Monday night. I'm a killer cook, and that way Ken and I could get to know each other better."<br><br>At that moment Ken felt like he'd rather eat glass.<br><br>Ken's father walked over and kissed Asha's delicate cheek. His big, ex-football-player's body dwarfed Asha's narrow frame. "You really don't need to do that."<br><br>"I know," Asha responded, her eyes lighting up with amusement. "I don't <i>have</i> to do anything. But it would be fun."<br><br>Ken's father shrugged. "Okay. Whatever you want."<br><br>They both looked at Ken for his response. Ken was still pissed off, but what was the point of telling them? His opinion didn't seem to matter anyway.<br><br>"Sure," he told them. "Whatever."</p><h2>The Essential Ellison: A 35-Year Retrospective</h2><p>An illustrated retrospective of the work of the acclaimed writer includes short stories, essays, personal reminiscences, and more</p><p></p><h2>La Bouche Creole</h2><p>Basic French cooking, gusty Spanish flavors, creativity, and a lot of love are Leon Soniat�s ingredients for la bouche Cr�ole (the Creole mouth).

From the Revolution to the New Deal, from the Civil War to World War II, race has been at the center of virtually every national turning point. In a brilliant book, Michael Goldfield doggedly documents the persistence of racism in the American nation through a penetrating assessment of racism in the labor movement.</p><br></p><p>Michael Goldfield teaches at the College of Urban Labor and Metropolitan Affairs at Wayne State University in Detroit.<br>Goldfield (Labor Studies/Wayne State Univ.) traces how race came to be at the heart of America's political vexations, and how and why it stays there. His survey is most useful in the portions offering an analysis of the past. Expanding W.E.B. DuBois's dictum that the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line, Goldfield endeavors to demonstrate that at critical turning points of political struggle since colonial times (the Revolution, the end of Reconstruction, the Depression and New Deal, etc.), race was again and again central to the outcome. And in his Marxian view, it has been the absence of interracial solidarity among white and black workers during key struggles that has led to two of the defining elements of contemporary politics: the weakness of American labor and an enduringly segregated nation. Exactly why white labor repeatedly failed to support black workers, though, remains elusive in Goldfield's account: The indifference of northern labor to Reconstruction, for example, is repeatedly and unhelpfully attributed to obtuseness. The evasion of this question has consequences for Goldfield's ability to usefully address contemporary politics. While the account of the postWW II period, especially the CIO's failed Operation Dixie, establishes a solid historical context for the recent history of progress and backlash, the chapter on the present offers a summary of macroeconomic shifts and an unobjectionable but familiar left-liberal response to racially coded issues like affirmative action. In short, having successfully postulated the centrality of race to a class analysis of American history, Goldfield fails to provide the logical epilogue and carry that class analysis fully into contemporary racial politics, sketching it out only briefly in short concluding remarks. Nevertheless, the focused examination of the role of race in shaping a broad range of American movements is enlightening in its own right, and the importance of the subject speaks for itself. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Only the fall of the Roman Empire fifteen hundred years earlier compares to the destruction visited on Germany. The country's cities lay in ruins, its economic base devastated. The German people stood at the brink of starvation, millions of them still in POW camps. This was the starting point as the Allies set out to build a humane, democratic nation on the ruins of the vanquished Nazi state-arguably the most monstrous regime the world has ever seen.<br>In <i>Exorcising Hitler</i>, master historian Frederick Taylor tells the story of Germany's Year Zero and what came next. He describes the bitter endgame of war, the murderous Nazi resistance, the vast displacement of people in Central and Eastern Europe, and the nascent cold war struggle between Soviet and Western occupiers. The occupation was a tale of rivalries, cynical realpolitik, and blunders, but also of heroism, ingenuity, and determination-not least that of the German people, who shook off the nightmare of Nazism and rebuilt their battered country.<br>Weaving together accounts of occupiers and Germans, high and low alike <i>Exorcising Hitler</i> is a tour de force of both scholarship and storytelling, the first comprehensive account of this critical episode in modern history.</p></p><p><p><b>Frederick Taylor</b> studied history and modern languages at Oxford and did postgraduate work at Sussex University.

By the Edgar Award-winning author of Good Blood.</p><p>Aaron Elkins is the author of the Edgar Award-winning Gideon Oliver mysteries.In Edgar-winner Elkins's solid 12th whodunit to feature forensic anthropologist Gideon Oliver (after 2004's acclaimed <i>Good Blood</i>), Oliver's Hawaiian vacation turns into a busman's holiday, as he and close friend John Lau, an FBI agent who's also enjoying some downtime, get involved in a decade-old mystery surrounding the deaths of two elderly Swedish brothers who owned a huge cattle ranch. One night in 1994, hit men acting for an unknown client murdered Torkel Torkelsson, then attempted to conceal the corpse with an act of arson; that same night, Magnus Torklesson and a pilot took off in a small plane, never to be heard from again. Now divers have discovered the wreckage of the long-lost plane in a lagoon, with some skeletal remains. Soon learning that none of the original police investigation's conclusions may be valid, Oliver and Lau find themselves intrigued and frustrated by the lies and evasions pitched rapidly at them by the Torkelssons' heirs, all of whom have different motives for obscuring the truth. Oliver's deductions will remind classic mystery readers of archetypal scientific sleuth Dr. Thorndyke, and his three-dimensional personality and humor will continue to attract first-timers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He had always been graceful; pliant, too, when fixing a price; a man who traded and left something in the deal for the other fellow.Overhead, the killer turned his head from side to side, alert to the slightest motion in the darkness, feeling the rain on his face. He stood for a few minutes, waiting and watching, before he blinked, turned, and padded softly from the bridge, to be swallowed up by the night and the alleyways of the sleeping city.The tide ebbed. The water sucked at the green weed that lined the walls, gurgled around old pilings, and slipped and receded from worn stone steps. It sank, nudging the trader closer to the sea on which, in her days of glory, the city had made her fortune. Beneath Byzantine domes, dilapidated palaces and tethered boats the corpse was hustled noiselessly towards the sea, arms still flung wide in a gesture of vacant welcome.Yet some obstruction, a block of stone or loop of rotten rope, must have checked his passage for a time; for when dawn broke, and the tide slackened, the trader was still yards away from the deep waters of the Riva dei Schiavoni into which he would have otherwise sunk without further trace.&nbsp;IIThe sultan gave a high-pitched sneeze and patted his face with a silk handkerchief.&#x2018;The Queen of England has one,&#x2019; he said petulantly.Resid Pasha bowed his head. King William was dead, like Sultan Mahmut: now, he thought, England and the Ottoman Empire were being ruled by little girls.&#x2018;As the sultan says, may his days be lengthened.&#x2019;&#x2018;The Hapsburgs have several galleries, I understand. In their dominions in Italy, whole palaces are stuffed with pictures.&#x2019; The sultan dabbed at his nose. &#x2018;The Emperor of Austria knows what his grandfather&#x2019;s grandfather was like by looking at his picture, Resid Pasha.&#x2019;The young pasha folded his slender hands. What the sultan said was true, but perfectly ridiculous: the Hapsburgs were notoriously ugly, notoriously alike. They married their close relations, and the chins got bigger every generation. Whereas an Ottoman prince had none but lovely and accomplished women to share his bed.Resid Pasha tensed his shoulders. &#x2018;The Austrian dogs always piss on the same spot,&#x2019; he said, with a jocular grunt. &#x2018;Who would want to see that?&#x2019;Even as he spoke, he knew he had made a mistake. Sultan Mahmut would have grinned at the remark; but Mahmut was dead.The sultan frowned. &#x2018;We are not speaking of dogs now.&#x2019;&#x2018;You are right, my padishah.&#x2019; Resid Pasha hung his head.&#x2018;I speak of the Conqueror,&#x2019; Abdulmecid said loftily. &#x2018;Of the blood in these veins.&#x2019; He held out his wrists, and the young counsellor bowed, abashed.&#x2018;If the picture exists, I wish for it,&#x2019; the sultan continued. &#x2018;I want to see it. Do you desire, Rasid Pasha, that the likeness of the Conqueror should be exposed to the infidel gaze&#x2014;or that an unbeliever should possess it?&#x2019;Resid Pasha sighed. &#x2018;And yet, my sultan, we do not know where the painting might be. If, indeed, it exists at all.&#x2019;The young Padishah sneezed again. While he examined his handkerchief, the Pasha pressed on: &#x2018;For more than three centuries, nobody ever saw or heard about this&#x2014; picture. Today we have a rumor, nothing more. Let us be cautious, my padishah. What does it matter if we wait another month? Another year? Truth is like musk, whose grateful odour can never be concealed.&#x2019;The sultan nodded, but not in agreement. &#x2018;There is a faster way,&#x2019; he said, in a voice treacled with mucus.&#x2018;Send for Yashim.&#x2019;&nbsp;III Close to the shoreline of the Golden Horn, on the Pera side, stood a fountain set up by an Ottoman princess as an act of generosity, on a spot where the boatmen used to linger and drop their fares. Hundreds of fountains existed in the streets and squares of Istanbul; but this one was particularly old and lovely, and Yashim had admired it many times as he passed. Sometimes, in hot weather, he would rinse his face in the trickle of clear water that splashed down onto the tiled basin.It was those tiles which now stopped him on the street, where he stood unnoticed and aghast in the stream of traffic passing along the shore: muleteers with their trains, porters under enormous sacks, two fully-veiled women attended by a black eunuch, a bashi-bazouk on horseback, his sash stuffed with pistols and swords. Neither Yashim, nor the ruined fountain, attracted anyone&#x2019;s attention: the crowd flowed round him, a man standing alone in a brown cloak, a white turban on his head, watching stricken as a trio of workmen in overalls and dirty turbans attacked the fountain with their hammers.It was not that Yashim lacked presence. His only lack was of something more definite; but he was used to passing unnoticed. It was as though his presence were a quality he could chose to display, or to conceal; a quality which certain people would be unaware of until they found themselves mesmerised by his grey eyes, his low, musical voice, or by the truths he spoke. Until then, though, he might be almost invisible.The workmen did not look up as he approached; only when he spoke did one of them glance round, surprised.&#x2018;It&#x2019;s the bridge, efendi. Once this has gone, then the tree, there&#x2019;ll be a way through here, see? Got to have a way through, efendi.&#x2019;Yashim&#x2019;s heart sank. A bridge linking Pera to the main city of Istanbul had been talked about for years. Centuries, even: in the sultan&#x2019;s archives in Topkapi Palace Yashim had once seen a sepia design for such a bridge, executed by an Italian engineer who wrote his letters back-to-front, as if they were written in a mirror. Now, it seemed, a bridge was about to be built: the new sultan&#x2019;s gift to a grateful populace.&#x2018;Can&#x2019;t this fountain just be moved aside?&#x2019;The workman straightened his back and leaned on his sledgehammer. &#x2018;What, this?&#x2019; He shrugged. &#x2018;Too old. New one&#x2019;d be better.&#x2019; His eyes slid along the shore. &#x2018;Not but what it&#x2019;s a shame about the tree.&#x2019;The tree was a colossus, and a welcome patch of shade and shelter on the Pera shore. It had stood for centuries: in days it would be gone.Yashim winced as a sledgehammer cracked down hard into the basin of the fountain. A chunk of stone broke away, and Yashim put out a hand.&#x2018;Please. A tile or two...&#x2019;He carried them away carefully, feeling the old mortar dry and brittle in his palm. The boatman who took him gliding across the Horn by caique spat on the water. &#x2018;The bridge, it&#x2019;ll kill us,&#x2019; he said, in Greek.Yashim felt a shadow across the sun. He did not risk a reply.Reaching home, he laid the tiles by the window and sat on the divan, contemplating the strong lines of the twining stems, the beautiful deep reds of the tulips, which had so often refreshed his eyes as the water of the fountain had refreshed his skin. Such flaming reds were unobtainable nowadays, he knew: centuries ago the potters of Iznik had fanned their talents to such heights that the river of knowledge had simply dried up. Blues there always were: lovely blues of Kayzeri and Iznik, but not the reds beloved of the heretics, who came from Iran and vanished in their turn.Yashim remembered how he had loved such tiles, where they decorated the inner sanctum of the sultan&#x2019;s palace at Topkapi, a place forbidden to all ordinary men. In the harem itself, home to the sultan and his family alone, many women had admired those tiles; and many sultans, too.Yashim had seen them only because he was not an ordinary man.Yashim was a eunuch.He was still gazing at the tiles, remembering others like them in the cool corridors of the sultan&#x2019;s harem, when a knock on the door announced the messenger.&nbsp;IVResid Pasha tapped his polished boot with a swizzle stick.&#x2018;The Sultan Mahmud, may he rest in peace, was pleased to order the construction of the bridge,&#x2019; he said evenly. He pointed his stick at the divan. &#x2018;The old city and Pera have been too much apart. That is also the view of the Padishah.&#x2019;&#x2018;Now Pera will come to Istanbul,&#x2019; Yashim said, &#x2018;and we will know no peace.&#x2019;Resid pursed his lips. &#x2018;Or perhaps the other way round, Yashim efendi.&#x2019;&#x2018;Yes, my pasha,&#x2019; Yashim said doubtfully. He took a seat, cross-legged, on the divan. &#x2018;Perhaps.&#x2019;He tried to picture Pera subsiding into dignified silence, as the sober pashas and the minarets and the cypresses of old Istanbul spread their leisurely influence across the bridge, stilling the perpetual scrimmage of touts, tea-boys, porters, bankers, shopkeepers and sailors that milled through the Pera streets. Where would the cypresses find space to grow, between the Belgian hatters and the Greek peddlers, the steam-presses and the foreign crowds? Old Ottoman gentlemen brought their families to Pera now and then, and led them in stately astonishment through crowds of every nationality and none, staring into the big glass w...</p><h2>Zen Dog</h2><p><p>A simple and captivating story about a very important dog and a trombone-playing ant with extraordinary powers.</p><p>A perfect gift for a friend or a loved one, Edward Monkton's most profound, quirky and inspirational illustrations are brought together once again in this exquisitely designed book.</p><p>There was once a very IMPORTANT dog.<br>He had a big office, a sharp suit, a fast car and the very snazziest of communications devices.<br>One day, on his way to an extremely important meeting, the dog cast half a lobster sandwich into a dustbin.<br>&#x201c;Ow!&#x201d; said an ant, appearing at the rim of the dustbin. &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I might ask the same of you,&#x201d; replied the dog indignantly.<br>&#x201c;Well then,&#x201d; said the ant, wiping a dollop of mayonnaise from his forehead, &#x201c;I shall tell you.

What are the differences?</b><br> Nice girls put everyone else&#x2019;s needs before their own. They hesitate to take action because they don&#x2019;t want to make waves or be labeled a bitch, and they don&#x2019;t ask for what they want so as not to appear high maintenance. Winning women factor their needs in with those of others. They know how to approach confrontations without being confrontational and they are willing to take risks in diplomatically asking for what they&#x2019;ve earned, deserve, or want. <p></p> <b>What are some of the most common mistakes women make when it comes to getting the things they most want in life and why do they make them?</b><br> 1. Not knowing what they want! Women have been socialized to put others needs before their own, so frequently they can&#x2019;t put a figure on exactly what it is they do want, or are afraid to express it for fear that others will see them as greedy or needy. <p></p> 2. Not knowing when it&#x2019;s time to walk away from a bad situation. Women often think they can turn it around or that it&#x2019;s their fault, when in fact neither is true. <p></p> 3. Communicating indirectly. They expect others to read their minds, use so many words when expressing themselves that others tune out or can&#x2019;t figure out what they really want, and put their assertions in the form of questions. All of these behaviors contribute to unclear and diluted messages. <p></p> <b> Why are men often better negotiators than women?</b><br> The reasons are complicated. Women are as good as men when they are negotiating on behalf of others (such as their families) but fall short when they are negotiating for themselves, for example, when they negotiate salary. <p></p> Nice girls have a particularly difficult time as negotiators because they tend to accept the rules as they are, failing to recognize they can challenge the status quo. Take the all-too-common situation of the woman who holds down a job and then heads home for the &#x201c;second shift.&#x201d; She fails to recognize the opportunity to negotiate a more equitable solution with her family--she&#x2019;s not the only person who&#x2019;s capable of sorting laundry and grocery shopping! <p></p> <b>When you look at high-profile contemporary women, who do you see getting it right?</b><br> People like Anne Mulcahy at Xerox, actor Sandra Bullock, and media mogul Oprah Winfrey are all getting it right. They haven&#x2019;t sacrificed their femininity to get what they want, and they don&#x2019;t suffer fools gladly. Each is a unique combination of the characteristics that make up the personalities of winning women. <p></p> <b> Give us three tips women can put to immediate use to start getting what they want--now!</b><br> 1. Define with crystal clarity what it is you want that you don&#x2019;t currently have. It could be a better job, to leave a bad relationship, or to tell your mother-in-law to butt out of your business. Until you can &#x201c;see&#x201d; and &#x201c;say&#x201d; what you want, you won&#x2019;t get it. <p></p> 2. Speak in headlines with taglines. The first thing out of your mouth should be your main point, not a lot of filler words. Give your opinion briefly and succinctly. Then follow it up with an inclusive tagline such as, &#x201c;You can see I have strong feelings about this. I&#x2019;d also like to know what you think.&#x201d; The tagline mitigates the impression of being too aggressive. <p></p> 3. Avoid V-8 moments. Rather than walk away from difficult conversations thinking, &#x201c;I should have said __________,&#x201d; prepare in advance for resistance. If you know your husband will be resistant to you going back to work, consider what his objections might be and have a response ready. <p></p>The name, DR.

Suspects include a coffee-bar waitress who helped Lillian with the cats, Lillian's schizophrenic son and an avaricious realtor who lives next<br><br>door and hates cats. Simon writes well about the visceral tug of today's rock music. We feel the feral heart of true hard rock, and the way the sound, the dancing and the booze all blend into something close to good sex.

His best works include Green Lantern/Green Arrow and Batman with Neal Adams, The Shadow with Mike Kaluta and The Question with Denys Cowan, all of which were hailed for sophisticated stories that expanded the artistic potential of the mainstream portion of the medium. As an editor, he is principally known for editing Batman. His 1970s run on Batman is perhaps his most well known endeavour, turning Batman from the campiness of the 1960s TV show, to &#34;The Batman&#34;, getting back to the character&#39;s darker roots and emphasizing his detective skills. This grimer and more sophisticated Dark Knight, as well as new villians such as Ra&#39;s Al Ghul, brought back Batman from the verge of pop culture oblivion. His work would influence later incarnations of Batman, from the seminal comic &#34;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&#34; by Frank Miller, to the movie Batman Begins in 2005.</p><h2>The Rogue Crew (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition) (Tale of Redwall)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

Yet it is all too true. With the publication of his first children's book in 1987, the award-winning Redwall, Jacques' fresh talent has received exceptional praise from reviewers in the United States and England. Newbery Award winner Lloyd Alexander called it "a fine work, literate, witty, filled with the excitement of genuine storytelling. Young people will surely be captivated. I hope they give their elders a chance to share the delights."<p> A well-known radio personality in his native Liverpool--as well as an actor, stand-up comic, and playwright--Brian Jacques is the host of "Jakestown" on BBC Radio Merseyside. Ever the performer, Jacques is well-known for applying his acting and entertainment background to his lively presentations to legions of young fans at schools across the United States and England.</p><p>Brian Jacques was born in Liverpool, England on June 15th, 1939. Along with forty percent of the population of Liverpool, his ancestral roots are in Ireland, County Cork to be exact.</p><p> He grew up in the area around the Liverpool docks. His interest in adventure stories began at an early age with reading the books of: Daniel Defoe, Sir Henry Rider Haggard, Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Thomas Malory, Robert Michael Ballantyne, Robert Louis Stevenson, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Kenneth Grahame. He attended St. John's School, an inner city school that had its playground on the roof. On his first day at St. John's, at the age of ten, he had an experience that marked his potential as a writer. When given an assignment of writing a story about animals, he wrote about the bird that cleaned a crocodile's teeth. The teacher could not, and would not, believe that a ten year old could write that well. When young Brian refused to falsely say that he had copied the story, he was caned as "a liar." He had always loved to write, but it was only then, that he realized that he had a talent for writing.</p><p> Some teachers at St. John's proved to be good role models. As Mr. Jacques recalls: </p><p> "My favourite teacher was Mr. Austin Thomas. He looked like Lee Marvin. Big Man. A Captain in World War II. He came to school on a big bush bike with the haversack on back. He was a man's man. Always fair. I was fourteen at the time when Mr. Thomas introduced the class to poetry and Greek literature. (Because of him, I saved seven shillings and sixpence to buy The Iliad and The Odyssey at this dusty used book shop.)"</p><p> This interest in poetry extended to Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Goldsmith. It was also at St. John's that Brian met a teacher, Alan Durband (who also taught two Beatles, Paul McCartney and George Harrison), who, more than thirty years later would bring about a major change in his life.</p><p> After Brian finished school at fifteen, he set out to find adventure as a merchant seaman. He travelled to many far away ports, including New York, Valparaiso, San Francisco, and Yokohama. Tiring of the lonely life of a sailor, he returned to Liverpool where he worked as a railway fireman, a longshoreman, a long-distance truck driver, a bus driver, a boxer, a bobby (Police Constable 216D), a postmaster, and a stand-up comic. </p><p>Penguin mourns the passing of celebrated children's book author Brian Jacques</p>"For satisfying swashbuckling, this Redwall saga delivers, with a ride-into-the-sunset conclusion."--"The Horn Book<br><br>""All of the late Jacques' signature elements are here . . .

Catalogue entries for 81 works draw extensively on interviews with the artist. A detailed chronology places Ryman&#39;s work in the context of his major contemporaries.</p><p>Robert Ryman is a nonfigurative artist who makes white paintings. One might think, upon a cursory examination of these works, that Ryman was an academic type, fond of the rhetoric of abstraction. But Ryman is self-taught, self-effacing, and rather romantic. Storr, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, summarizes Ryman's quiet life and elucidates his passionate but methodical approach to painting with consummate narrative skills, supporting his commentary with excerpts from numerous interviews with the artist and, of course, a superb set of, yes, colorplates. Ryman's first medium was music. A bebop saxophone player, he took a day job as a guard at the Museum of Modern Art and scrutinized the masters for seven years until, suddenly, in 1953, he began to paint. He's been at it ever since. Ryman chose, early on, to work within strict limitations, hence the white paint, and has devoted himself to seeing "what visual riches can be coaxed from such slender means," a mission not unlike the improvisations of jazz. Curiously, like many jazz musicians of his generation, his work has been more highly regarded in Europe than in America, but a major traveling retrospective exhibition, and this fine volume, will increase his visibility and earn him the recognition he deserves. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Eager for Glory: The Untold Story of Drusus The Elder, Conqueror of Germania</h2><p>Drusus the Elder (Nero Claudius Drusus) was regarded by the Romans as the first conqueror of Germania (western Germany) and a hero in the mold of Alexander the Great. Yet there has never been a full volume dedicated to his remarkable story, achievements and legacy. Eager for Glory brings this heroic figure back to life for a modern audience.<br> <br>Drusus was a stepson of Augustus, the first Roman emperor, through his marriage to Livia. As a commander he led daring campaigns by sea and land that pushed the northern frontiers of Rome's empire to the Elbe River. He oversaw one of the largest developments of military infrastructure of the age. He married Mark Antony's daughter, Antonia, and fathered Germanicus, the Empire's most popular general, and the future emperor Claudius. He died when he was only 29 and was revered in death.<br> <br>Eager for Glory is an objective and thoroughly researched account, written in a lucid narrative style, which reveals the author's passion for the period.</p><p>Lindsay Powell writes for Ancient Warfare magazine and his articles have also appeared in Military Heritage and Strategy and Tactics. He is author of the highly acclaimed Marcus Agrippa: Right-Hand Man of Caesar Augustus, Germanicus: The Magnificent Life and Mysterious Death of Rome's Most Popular General and Eager for Glory: The Untold Story of Drusus the Elder, Conqueror of Germania, all published by Pen &amp; Sword Books. His appearances include BBC Radio, British Forces Broadcasting Service and History Channel. He divides his time between Austin, Texas and Wokingham, England.&#x201c;Powell gives a solid account of the life and times of Drusus with an enviable lightness of literary touch. More to the point, he pulls off the difficult task of putting Drusus' career into the context of the political machinations of the early empire...Powell clearly understands both the psychology of the Roman soldier and the practical issues of day-to-day life in the military in nuanced detail.&#x201d; (Adrian Murdoch <i>United Nations of Roma Victrix History</i>)<br><br>"Eager for Glory is worthy of a place on the shelf of any ancient warfare fan. It is warmly recommended." (<i>Ancient Warfare</i>)<br><br>"This ground-breaking book will appeal to all interested in ancient world history, biography, military history and adventure stories, but will be of particular interest to those studying classics in academia, Roman period re-enactment and numismatics." (<i>Heritage and History</i>)<br><br>"... is a remarkably readable book. We don't know a lot about Drusus, and most of the accounts of his campaigns are lost, but Lindsay Powell gathers together what there is and produces a coherent account. Thus we have the story of the life of Drusus, an outline of his campaigns, an attempt to estimate which legions were involved, his death and legacy. Given the state of the evidence, it is impossible to provide 'orders of battle' for the participants in these campaigns, but the author does try to give as much detail as possible with regard to the participants, with photographs of re-enactors and the terrain. The author also looks at the reasons for the Romans deciding to stop and set the Rhine rather than the Elbe as a frontier, a decision of long-tern historical significance. A nice book that I enjoyed." (<i>Miniature Wargames</i>)<br><br>"... documents the life of Roman politician and soldier Drusus the Elder &#x2013; whose real name was Nero Claudius Drusus &#x2013; who was the first Roman general to begin the conquest of Germania, which is better known today as Germany....In short it is a rip-roaring yarn and tale of a young man growing up at a critical period in history. It is the story of a soldier, explorer, diplomat, builder and genuine Roman hero who is revered in death.&#x201c;I think it is a thrilling story.&#x201d; (<i>Wokingham Times</i>)<br><br>A real pleasure to read a book that is a page-turner for anyone interested in Ancient Rome!" (Alberto P�rez Rubio, Editor, Desperta Ferro.)<br><br>&#x201c;Admitting the sparsity of evidence directly related to Drusus, Powell has nonetheless done an excellent job. Gathering all the literary evidence and carefully sorting through the archaeological record, which has in recent years piled up wonderfully, he has sifted through appropriate evidence of what is known about other generals and campaigns from the period, and then added a useful dose of his own experience as a Roman re-enactor. The result is a surprisingly detailed, readable look at a long-forgotten great captain.&#x201d; (<i>StrategyPage</i>)</p><h2>The Ashford Book of Spinning</h2><p>Spinning is a practical, fascinating and satisfying hobby with continuing appeal in an age of mass production.

Now she returns to Deverry's war-ravaged past. . . .&nbsp;</b><br><br>In a kingdom torn by civil war, young Lillorigga seeks to shield her dawning powers from her cruel mother Merodda's manipulation. Mistress of a magic that, untamed, could kill her, Lilli brings her terrifying visions under the kindlier tutelage of the mysterious dweomermaster, Nevyn. But soon she must choose between her own clan and the true king who fights to claim his rightful throne, between sanctuary and blood feud, loyalty and love. Little does she dream that the slaughter she invites, and the malevolence she defies, could stalk her across the ages...twisting and twining the strands of timeless destinies.</p><p>Long, long ago in Deverry, Lillorigga, daughter of the Boar clan and cousin to the child-king, becomes enmeshed in the increasingly sinister politics at the palace of Dun Deverry. Not least among the plotters is Lilli&#39;s own mother, the enchantress Merodda. Lilli has inherited Merodda&#39;s powers, but not her taste for power. When Merodda orders the death of Lilli&#39;s foster mother, Bevyan, Lilli leaves Deverry swearing revenge. Her actions will have consequences not only in her time, but also in generations to come, as those who die are reincarnated.Praise for Katharine Kerr:<p>"Katharine Kerr is both a good writer and a thorough Celtic scholar.

In keeping with the mass media&#39;s glib assumption that a phenomenal increase in wealth for a minority meant genuine national prosperity, the 1990s saw an astounding refusal, on both the left and right, to question received wisdom or engage in substantive deliberation. Turning her acute eye to the decade&#39;s defining moments-imbroglios like those surrounding the O. J. Simpson trial, The Bell Curve, Monica-gate, and the Million Man March-Ellen Willis reveals the mindlessness behind the noise. Arguing that we suffer from a lack of true freedom, she demands that we radically rethink our country and ourselves to create a society in which we can fully enjoy life.</p><p>The liberal cause finds a backbone in Ellen Willis's supple collection of essays. Whether writing about feminism, freedom of speech, O.J. Simpson, or <i>The Bell Curve</i>, Willis presents arguments that are always thought-provoking, and always meant to reconnect the current political divide between the economic and cultural concerns of liberals in order to strengthen the liberal position. "The left will continue to lose ground," Willis insists, "unless it gives up the untenable distinction between economics and culture to which it is stubbornly attached." Willis inspires political liberals to stop second-guessing what mainstream America really wants, and to stand behind real concerns about the rights to freedom and pleasure. <i>Don't Think, Smile!</i> has plenty to spar about, but one will do so with a truly invigorating pugilist. <i>--Maria Dolan</i>Formerly a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> and <i></i>The Village Voice, Ellen Willis is director of the cultural reporting and criticism program in the department of journalism at New York University.

Dispelling common notions of Thoreau as a lonely eccentric cloistered at Walden Pond, Sullivan (whom the <em>New York Times Book Review </em>calls &#x201c;an urban Thoreau&#x201d;) paints a dynamic picture of Thoreau as the naturalist who founded our American ideal of &#x201c;the Great Outdoors;&#x201d; the rugged individual who honed friendships with Ralph Waldo Emerson and other writers; and the political activist who inspired Martin Luther King, Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, and other influential leaders of progressive change. You know Thoreau is one of America&#x2019;s legendary writers...but the Thoreau you don&#x2019;t know may be one of America&#x2019;s greatest heroes.<br></p><p><p>Henry David Thoreau is one of those authors that readers think they know, even if they don't. He's the solitary curmudgeon with the shack out in the woods, the mystic worshipping solemnly in the quiet church of nature. He's our national Natural Man, the prophet of environmentalism. But here Robert Sullivan&#x2014;who himself has been called an "urban Thoreau" (<em>New York Times Book Review</em>)&#x2014;presents the Thoreau you don't know: the activist, the organizer, the gregarious adventurer, the guy who likes to go camping with friends (even if they sometimes accidentally burn the woods down). Sullivan argues that Walden was a book intended to revive America, a communal work forever pigeonholed as a reclusive one, and this misreading is at the heart of our troubled relationship with the environment today. Sullivan shows us not a lonely eccentric but a man in his growing village: a man who danced and sang, who worked throughout his short life at the family pencil-making business, and moved into his parents' house after leaving Walden, but always paid his father rent. Passionate yet whimsical, <em>The Thoreau You Don't Know</em> asks us to re-examine our everyday relationship with the natural world, and one another.</p><p>Robert Sullivan is the author of <em>The Meadowlands</em>, <em>A Whale Hunt</em>, <em>Rats</em>, and <em>Cross Country</em>. A contributing editor to <em>Vogue</em>, his writing has also appeared in the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, and <em>Dwell</em> magazine.

Andrew Sachs&#39;s relaxed narration encourages the listener to enter Pluto&#39;s dark, underground kingdom as well as Pandora&#39;s bed-chamber. Sachs uses a broad range of vocal expression and varies his style from story to story, easing the transition between tales and creating a graceful flow. His rendering of the drunken Cyclops and the dim-witted giants is really funny. This excellent recording of sixteen familiar myths will send children scurrying to the bookshelves in search of more stories of that far-off time. L.R.S. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineThe much-honored McCaughrean (A Pack of Lies, 1989, Carnegie Medal) slyly telegraphs the philosophy behind these grand renditions in describing how Athene turns Arachne into a spider to punish the matchless weaver for her arrogance--yet Arachne's gloriously beautiful fabric depicts the gods doing ``silly things...squabbling, lazing about, and bragging. In fact she made them look just as foolish as ordinary folk.'' McCaughrean is as irreverent, and as delightfully artful, in these 17 stories and epics retold in a contemporary style enlivened with snappy dialogue, whimsical descriptions, dramatic vignettes, and ingenious embroideries and explanations (Heracles gets Atlas to take the sky back because ``These stars do prickle''; Polyphemus gobbled two of Odysseus's men, then ``spat out their belts and sandals''). Beginning with Prometheus's creation of man and concluding with his release, McCaughrean provides enough links to give a sense of complicated community. Important particulars are intact and given in some detail (King Midas's problem with donkey's ears as well as his tactile troubles), though without the more horrendous aftermaths (Jason and Medea simply ``lived together as man and wife''). A deliciously witty reminder that, as McCaughrean says, these myths ``are just too good to forget.'' Clark's lovely, lighthearted watercolors, depicting most of the characters as foolish but appealing innocents, are generously supplied on every page. A splendid offering.

In this slender volume, Yeager sets out to give readers a basic appreciation for storms, winds, freezing rain, puffy clouds and the like, by first giving readers a breakdown of just what these things are. Hail, for instance, happens when supercooled water freezes on dust particles that are then pushed back into clouds via updraft, over and over again, accumulating more water, and more size, until they finally crash onto our heads and cars. <br><br> Like a science teacher who clearly enjoys his subject and has a knack for explaining it, Yeager's easy-to-digest writing comes with a lot of requisite enthusiasm. Lightning doesn't get enough respect, he writes-and did you know that the "temperature of a lightning bolt is estimated to be as much as 54,000oF (five times the temperature of the sun)"? The book is packed with fascinating facts like these. Yeager reveals that "it's always cooler after a thunderstorm"; that seeking shelter under a highway overpass during a tornado is a really bad idea (the speed of the wind will increase); that "snow-eating wind" allows snow to vanish rather than melt and a whole lot of sports-and-weather phenomena like the fact that high humidity "allows a baseball to travel farther, increasing the likelihood of home runs."

In this riveting and insightful cultural history, Lucy Hughes-Hallett brings to life eight exceptional men from history and myth whose outsized accomplishments made them heroes of their times.<br><br>Alcibiades was Athens&#x2019;s most dazzling citizen but an incorrigible traitor. El Cid was an invincible but self-interested warlord. Albrecht von Wallenstein terrified both enemies and allies in the Thirty Years&#x2019; War. Despite their flaws, all three were celebrated as superhuman paragons of virility. We see them in contrast to heroes of a different kind: Cato, the stubborn opponent of dictatorship; Sir Francis Drake, who used wit instead of might to defeat the Spanish; and Giuseppe Garibaldi, the gallant revolutionary and international celebrity. Framing these six men are the two paradigmatic Homeric heroes: Achilles, who sacrificed his life for glory, and Odysseus, who lied and cheated and stole, doing anything to survive. <br><br>As Hughes-Hallett vividly re-creates these extraordinary lives, she illuminates the attractions and dangers of hero worship. This is a fascinating book about dictatorship and democracy, seduction and mass hysteria, politics and culture, and the eternal tension between the Achillean glorification of death and the Odyssean affirmation of life.</p><p>Lucy Hughes-Hallett is a critic for <i>The Sunday Times</i> (London) and the author of <i>Cleopatra: Histories, Dreams and Distortions</i>.

Achilles, paragon of warriors, consents to enter the fight. Ready for battle in the armor made for him by the smith god Hephaestus, he glitters like the sun. His teeth grind, his eyes flash fire. With a voice as plangent as a trumpet&#x2019;s he calls out to his immortal horses which no other man can master and one of them replies. Yes, says the beast, this time the team will bring their master safely back to the Greek camp, but the day of his death already hovers near and when it comes, even were they to have the speed and power of the west wind, they would not be able to save him: &#x201c;You are doomed to die violently, Achilles.&#x201d; Achilles&#x2019; reply is impatient: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t waste your breath, I know, well I know.&#x201d; With a terrifying yell he sends his chariot hurtling into the front line.<br><br>Of all the warriors who fight at Troy Achilles is the only one who is bound to die there. He is not courting risk: he is confronting certainty, and he himself must take responsibility for his own end. His mother, the goddess Thetis, has told him of the two destinies between which he must chose. He can stay peaceably in his father&#x2019;s house, and if he does so his life will be long and fruitful. He can marry and have children. He can use his wealth and amass more. He can exploit his strength and exercise his intellect. He can inherit and rule his father&#x2019;s kingdom, enjoying the satisfactions of power and, in due time, the respect accorded to an elder. Or he can fight. If he chooses the latter he will be killed before the war&#x2019;s end, but first he will win such glory that his name will live in song forevermore.<br><br>He chooses death, buying immortality at the cost of his life. And so he becomes the paradigmatic hero, one whose traits and actions are echoed, with infinite variations, in the life stories of subsequent heroes both legendary and actual. His beauty, his swiftness and ferocity, his unrivaled talent for killing his fellow men, his uncompromising commitment both to honesty and to honor and, above all, the pathos of his freely accepted death combine to invest him with an ineffable glamour.<br><br>His choice is not easy. There is an alternative. There is another Homeric epic and another hero, Odysseus, who chooses life, and who is so determined to hang on to all that Achilles has renounced that he will lie, cheat, and steal for it. Odysseus is an intriguer, a shapeshifter, a warrior like Achilles but one noted primarily not for his actions but for his words. Achilles&#x2019; foil, he repeatedly calls into question the values Achilles represents&#x2014;both tacitly, by his very existence as one who has taken the opposite path, and explicitly on the several occasions when the two confront each other. In the stories of the heroes who come after them the characteristics of Odysseus and Achilles combine and alternate, but for Achilles himself there can be no half measures, no partial sacrifice. His choice is absolute and tragic. The brilliance with which his prowess and his physical splendor invest him is simultaneously shadowed and intensified by his inconsolable grief at the prospect of his own end, by his pity for his father and mother in the anguish his death must bring them, and his mourning for all that he might have been. Throughout the Iliad Homer imagines him questioning the bargain he has made (and which he can at any moment revoke&#x2014;three days&#x2019; sailing would take him home), asking at each setback, &#x201c;Was it for this&#x201d; that he decided to forgo so much? He neither despises life nor belittles death. The former he knows to be worth more than all the wealth in the world. The prospect of the latter is dreadful to him. He describes the underworld habitations of the dead as &#x201c;dank moldering horrors / that fill the deathless gods themselves with loathing,&#x201d; and he dwells obsessively on the ignominies to which dead flesh is subject.<br><br>If Achilles ever lived (something unlikely ever to be proven) he inhabited a culture separated from us by over three millennia, by tremendous changes in belief, in accepted morality, in technology, in human knowledge. Yet his story, as told by Homer, addresses questions as troubling now as they were when Agamemnon&#x2019;s host laid siege to Troy. &#x201c;Like the generations of leaves, the lives of mortal men,&#x201d; so a Trojan warrior tells a Greek, as they prepare to fight to the death. The Greek has asked to know his antagonist&#x2019;s identity. The Trojan&#x2019;s point is that the question is otiose. If each individual is as expendable and replaceable as this year&#x2019;s leaves, it scarcely matters who anyone might be. Before the fact of mortality any achievement seems futile, any quarrel petty. Death would make nihilists of us all, were it not for the passion with which humans struggle against its reductive, equalizing influence. Achilles will give anything, including life itself, to assert his own uniqueness, to endow his particular life with significance, and to escape oblivion.<br><br>A non-Homeric legend tells how Achilles&#x2019; divine mother sought to make her baby invulnerable by dipping him in the waters of the Styx, the river over which the souls of the dead were ferried to the underworld. The attempt was unsuccessful. The heel by which Thetis held Achilles remained dry, and it was in that heel that he eventually received his fatal wound. Thetis could not keep her son alive, but he was to find his own way to life eternal, a way closely analogous to the one she tried. Just as she had sought to save him from dying by immersing him in the waters of death&#x2019;s river, so he cheated death by embracing it, voluntarily dying in his quest for everlasting life.<br><br>The Iliad begins with a quarrel over a girl. Two female prisoners have been awarded, by the consent of the full Greek army, one to Agamemnon, king and commander-in-chief, and one to the supreme warrior Achilles, as part of the prize due to each for their exploits in the war. The girl given to Agamemnon is the daughter of a priest of Apollo. The angry god retaliates by sending down a plague. An assembly is called. Reluctantly Agamemnon agrees to return the girl to her father, but demands compensation. If he cannot keep his own prize he will take someone else&#x2019;s. Achilles, who is not only the paragon of warriors but also the scrupulous guardian of the warriors&#x2019; code of honor, protests that to do so would be disgraceful. Agamemnon is defiant. He is the overlord: he will have his way regardless of another&#x2019;s opinion: &#x201c;Let that man I go visit choke with rage.&#x201d; Achilles, beside himself, declares that he will sail for home if Agamemnon perpetrates such an outrage against the code of conduct they all observe. Agamemnon rounds on him and declares his intention of taking Achilles&#x2019; own prize, the girl Briseis. For a moment Achilles is ready to kill him, but he is restrained by the voice of wisdom, Pallas Athena. Instead he swears a great oath that he will not fight again in the quarrels of the house of Atreus. Leaving the assembly he goes to his tent, way out at the end of the Greek lines, and there he stays. The rage of Achilles, the passion which is at once so disastrous and so magnificent, and which has earned his immortality, is not the savage bloodthirst which drives him on the battlefield, but the principled fury which keeps him off it.<br><br>This argument is far more than a squabble over possession of a slave. It is a dispute over the nature of superiority. Agamemnon tells Achilles he will take his girl &#x201c;so you can learn just how much greater I am than you.&#x201d; But is a man&#x2019;s worth dependent on his power, or on his talent? Is it a function of his social and political relationships, or can an individual possess a value independent of his place in the community? Is Agamemnon, as old Nestor says, the more to be honored &#x201c;because he rules more men&#x201d;? Or might Achilles, whose claim to supremacy lies entirely in himself, in his own particular, unsurpassed brilliance, be the greater man? These questions are fundamental. Their answers must affect the conduct both of individuals and of states, determining the relationship between political institutions and the people of whom they are constituted.<br><br>Achilles is a divinely created aristocrat, a living demonstration that men are not born equal. The son of a goddess and repeatedly described by Homer as being himself &#x201c;godlike,&#x201d; he is innately superior to his fellows. Pindar, the fifth-century bc poet who was classical Athens&#x2019; most eloquent upholder of the class system, celebrated his prowess, his &#x201c;hands like Ares&#x2019;, his feet like lightning.&#x201d; In the Iliad he is physically magnificent. When he loses his armor he cannot borrow more from any of his fellow Greeks, for none of them, with the possible exception of Ajax, is as tall as he. The perfection of his body is sublime, the loveliness of his features flawless. His beauty, potently erotic, marks him, like Helen, as a superhuman being. He is &#x201c;brilliant,&#x201d; literally: in armor he shines like the sun. He is faster than any of his peers and therefore more deadly in battle. When he chases Hector three times round the walls of Troy, hunting him as a hawk hunts a terrified dove, it is his speed as much as his courage and his strength which makes him invincible. Destined never to grow old, he has a young man&#x2019;s splendor and a young man&#x2019;s energy. His emotions are extreme, his responses passionate, his actions devastating. For all these reasons he is unique among the Homeric warriors. Nestor may be wiser, Odysseus more astute and articulate, Ajax stronger in a hand-to-hand fight, but Achilles is, by common consent, the &#x201c;best of the Achaeans.&#x201d; Only Agamemnon disputes his right to that title, and he does so on political grounds. He doesn&#x2019;t claim that he is a greater individual than Achilles. He...</p><h2>Le Ton beau de Marot</h2><p>Lost in an art the art of translation. Thus, in an elegant anagram (translation = lost in an art), Pulitzer Prize-winning author and pioneering cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter hints at what led him to pen a deep personal homage to the witty sixteenth-century French poet Cl�ment Marot.&#x201d;<i>Le ton beau de Marot</i>&#x201d; literally means &#x201d;The sweet tone of Marot&#x201d;, but to a French ear it suggests &#x201d;Le tombeau de Marot&#x201d; that is, &#x201d;The tomb of Marot&#x201d;. That double entendre foreshadows the linguistic exuberance of this book, which was sparked a decade ago when Hofstadter, under the spell of an exquisite French miniature by Marot, got hooked on the challenge of recreating both its sweet message and its tight rhymes in English jumping through two tough hoops at once.In the next few years, he not only did many of his own translations of Marot's poem, but also enlisted friends, students, colleagues, family, noted poets, and translators even three state-of-the-art translation programs! to try their hand at this subtle challenge.The rich harvest is represented here by 88 wildly diverse variations on Marot's little theme. Yet this barely scratches the surface of <i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i>, for small groups of these poems alternate with chapters that run all over the map of language and thought.Not merely a set of translations of one poem, <i>Le Ton beau de Marot </i>is an autobiographical essay, a love letter to the French language, a series of musings on life, loss, and death, a sweet bouquet of stirring poetry but most of all, it celebrates the limitless creativity fired by a passion for the music of words.Dozens of literary themes and creations are woven into the picture, including Pushkin's<i> Eugene Onegin</i>, Dante's <i>Inferno,</i> Salinger's <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>, Villon's<i> Ballades, </i>Nabokov's essays, Georges Perec's <i>La Disparition,</i> Vikram Seth's <i>Golden Gate, </i>Horace's odes, and more.Rife with stunning form-content interplay, crammed with creative linguistic experiments yet always crystal-clear, this book is meant not only for lovers of literature, but also for people who wish to be brought into contact with current ideas about how creativity works, and who wish to see how today's computational models of language and thought stack up next to the human mind.<i>Le Ton beau de Marot </i>is a sparkling, personal, and poetic exploration aimed at both the literary and the scientific world, and is sure to provoke great excitement and heated controversy among poets and translators, critics and writers, and those involved in the study of creativity and its elusive wellsprings.</p><p>In the fall of 1537, a child was confined to bed for some time. The French poet Cl�ment Marot wrote her a get-well poem, 28 lines long, each line a scant three syllables. In the mid-1980s, the outrageously gifted Douglas R. Hofstadter--<i>il miglior fabbro</i> of <i>Godel, Escher, Bach</i>--first attempted to translate this "sweet, old, small elegant French poem into English." He was later to challenge friends, relations, and colleagues to do the same. The results were exceptional, and are now contained in <i>Le Ton Beau De Marot</i>, a sunny exploration of scholarly and linguistic play and love's infinity. Less sunny, however, is the tragedy that hangs over Hofstadter's book, the sudden death of his wife, Carol, from a brain tumor. (Her translation is among the book's finest.)<p> Marot's poem, in Hofstadter's initial translation (he is to compose many more), begins: "My sweet, / I bid you / A good day; / The stay / Is prison. / Health / Recover, / Then open / Your door ... "--a slim frame on which to hang 600 or so pages of text. But the book is far more than a compendium of translators' triumphs (with the occasional misstep). Most of the renderings are original and lively, some lovely, though Hofstadter often feels compelled to improve them. He lightly laments that Bill Cavnar's rendering, "though superb along so many dimensions at once, still seems to lack a bit of that intangible verbal sparkle that I associate with the deepest Maroticity."</p><p> Hofstadter's talents lie in linking his intoxication, erudition, and vision with humor, autobiography, and free association. His book takes on "rigidists," asks questions like, "Is plagiarism potentially creative?" and strives to define linguistic soul. Along the way, it accords the same level of respect to the seemingly trivial: sex jokes, Texas jokes, <i>The Seven Year Itch</i>, and the puzzle of how someone you love can hate a food that you adore. Throughout there is pun, ingenuity, and above all, love for language--which can compress distance and, through constraint, lead to freedom.</p><b>Douglas R.

It opened its doors to over 10,000 endangered children-90 percent of them Jewish-from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. These children were taken into foster homes and hostels in Britain, expecting eventually to be reunited with their parents. Most of the children never saw their families again. </p><p><i>Into the Arms of Strangers</i> recounts the remarkable story of this rescue operation, known as the Kindertransport, and its dramatic impact on the lives of the children who were saved. The book is the companion to the feature-length documentary to be released in the theatres by Warner Bros. in Fall 2000. It contains stories in their own words from the child survivors, rescuers, parents, and foster parents. They recount, in harrowing detail, the effects of the Nazi's reign of terror, the horror of Kristallnacht, the agonizing decision by the parents to send their children away, the journey, the difficulties of adjustment in Britain, the outbreak of war, and the children's tragic discovery afterward that most of their parents had perished in concentration camps. </p><p>The stories are heartbreaking, but also inspiring. These are the stories of those who survived with the help of others; they are stories about the strength and resolve of children; and most astonishing, these are stories not yet heard about the Holocaust.</p></p><p>Between December 1938 and the outbreak of war in August 1939, some 10,000 children, the vast majority of them Jews, from Germany, Austria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia were evacuated to Great Britain. The stories of 18 witnesses to this <i>Kindertransport</i>--children, parents, and rescuers--are recounted in <i>Into the Arms of Strangers</i>.<p> These first-person accounts are woven into a loose narrative of life before the Nazi era, the transport, and life in their new homes. The editors wisely remain in the background, allowing the survivor testimony to shine through. Their experiences were diverse: some stayed behind, such as Norbert Wollheim, a <i>Kindertransport</i> organizer who refused a number of chances to escape from Germany, knowing that if he did, the transports would be stopped. Lory Cahn was actually on a train when her father pulled her off; he was unable to let her go. Those who made it to England found challenges of their own: some remained in hostels for the remainder of the war; some were taken in by families to work as cheap servant labor; still others were taken in by loving families, but then had to deal with "survivor's guilt."</p><p> Years after the war, Vera Gissing asked her foster father why he and his family had taken her in. He answered, "I knew I could not save the world. I knew I could not stop the war from starting. But I knew I could save one human life." <i>Into the Arms of Strangers</i> is a moving tribute to this remarkable event. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p><p><b>Mark Jonathan Harris</b>, a Harvard graduate, is the two-time Academy Award winner, most recently for the 1997 Best Feature-Length Documentary, "The Long Way Home."

I'm sitting on the floor in front of the electric fan, and the cool air feels good against my face. Very quiet I am talking into the fan so I can hear the buzzy, low voice it blows back at me. "I am Petra, Princess of the World," I say. I hear something outside my window and for a minute I am scared and want to go wake up Mom and Dad. I crawl across my carpet on my hands, the rug rubbing against my knees all rough. I peek out the window and in the dark I think I see someone looking up at me, big and scary. Then I see something smaller at his side. Oh, I'm not scared anymore. I know them. I think, "Wait, I'm coming, too!" For a second I think I shouldn't go. But there is a grown-up out there, too. Mom and Dad can't get mad at me if there's a grown-up. I pull on my tennis shoes and sneak out of my room. I'll just go say hi, and come right back in.<br><br><em>Calli</em><br><br>Calli and her father had been walking for a while now, but Calli knew exactly where they were and where they were not within the sprawling woods. They were near Beggar's Bluff Trail, where pink-tipped turtleheads grew in among the ferns and rushes and where Calli would often see sleek, beautiful horses carrying their owners gracefully through the forest. Calli wished that a cinnamon-colored mare or a black-splotched Appaloosa would crash from the trees, startling her father back to his senses. But it was Thursday and Calli rarely encountered another person on the trails near her home during the week. There was a slight chance that they would run into a park ranger, but the rangers had over thirty miles of trails to monitor and maintain. Calli knew she was on her own and resigned herself to being dragged through the forest with her father. They were nowhere near Deputy Sheriff Louis's home. Calli could not decide whether this was a good thing or not. Bad because her father showed no indication of giving up his search and Calli's bare feet were scratched from being pulled across rocky, uneven paths. Good because if they ever did get to Deputy Louis's home her father would say unforgivable things and then Louis would, in his calm low voice, try to quiet him and then call Calli's mother. His wife would be standing in the doorway behind him, her arms crossed, eyes darting furtively around to see who was watching the spectacle.<br><br>Her father did not look well. His face was white, the color of bloodroot, the delicate early spring flower that her mother showed to her on their walks in the woods, his coppery hair the color of the red sap from its broken roots. Periodically stumbling over an exposed root, he continued to clutch Calli's arm, all the time muttering under his breath. Calli was biding her time, waiting for the perfect moment to bolt, to run back home to her mother.<br><br>They were approaching a clearing named Willow Wallow. Arranged in a perfect half-moon adjacent to the creek was an arc of seven weeping willows. It was said that the seven willows were brought to the area by a French settler, a friend of Napoleon Bonaparte, the willows a gift from the great general, the wispy trees being his favorite.<br><br>Calli's mother was the kind of mother who would climb trees with her children and sit among the branches, telling them stories about her great-great-grandparents who immigrated to the United States from Czechoslovakia in the 1800s. She would pack the three of them a lunch of peanut butter fluff sandwiches and apples and they would walk down to Willow Creek. They would hop across the slick, moss-covered rocks that dotted the width of the creek. Antonia would lay an old blanket under the long, lacy branches of a willow tree and they would crawl into its shade, ropy tendrils surrounding them like a cloak. There the willows would become huts on a deserted island; Ben, back when he had time for them, was the brave sailor; Calli, his dependable first mate; Antonia, the pirate chasing them, calling out with a bad cockney accent. "Ya landlubbers, surrender an' ya won' haf to walk da plank!"<br><br>"Never!" Ben yelled back. "You'll have to feed us to the sharks before we surrender to the likes of you, Barnacle Bart!"<br><br>"So be it! Prepare ta swim wid da fishes!" Antonia bellowed, flourishing a stick.<br><br>"Run, Calli!" Ben screeched and Calli would. Her long pale legs shadowed with bruises from climbing trees and skirting fences, Calli would run until Antonia would double over, hands on her knees.<br><br>"Truce, truce!" Antonia would beg. The three of them would retreat to their willow hut and rest, sipping soda as the sweat cooled on their necks. Antonia's laugh bubbled up from low in her chest, unfettered and joyous. She would toss her head back and close eyes that were just beginning to show the creases of age and disappointment. When Antonia laughed, those around her did, too, except for Calli. Calli hadn't laughed for a long time. She smiled her sweet, close-lipped grin, but an actual giggle, which once was emitted freely and sounded of chimes, never came, though she knew her mother waited expectantly.<br><br>Antonia was the kind of mother who let you eat sugar cereal for Sunday supper and pizza for breakfast. She was the kind of mom who, on rainy nights, would declare it Spa Night and in a French accent welcome you to Toni's House of Beauty. She would fill the old claw-foot bathtub full of warm, lilac-scented bubbles and then, after rubbing you dry with an oversize white towel, would paint your toenails Wicked Red, or mousse and gel your hair until it stood at attention in three-inch spikes.<br><br>Griff, on the other hand, was the kind of father who drank Bud Light for breakfast and dragged his seven-year-old daughter through the forest in a drunken search for his version of the truth. The sun beginning to rise, Griff sat the two of them down beneath one of the willow trees to rest.<br><br><em>Martin</em><br><br>I can feel Fielda's face against my back, her arm wrapped around my ever-growing middle. It's too hot to lie in this manner, but I don't nudge her away from me. Even if I was in Dante's Inferno, I could not push Fielda away from me. We have only been apart two instances since our marriage fourteen years ago and both times seemed too much for me to bear. The second time that Fielda and I were apart I do not speak about. The first separation was nine months after our wedding and I went to a conference on economics at the University of Chicago. I remember lying in the hotel on my lumpy bed with its stiff, scratchy comforter, wishing for Fielda. I felt weightless without her there, that without her arm thrown carelessly over me in sleep, I could just float away like milkweed on a random wind. After that lonely night I forewent the rest of my seminars and came home.<br><br>Fielda laughed at me for being homesick, but I know she was secretly pleased. She came to me late in my life, a young, brassy girl of eighteen. I was forty-two and wed to my job as a professor of economics at St. Gilianus College, a private college with an enrollment of twelve hundred students in Willow Creek. No, she was not a student; many have asked this question with a light, accusatory tone. I met Fielda Mourning when she was a waitress at her family's caf�, Mourning Glory. On my way to the college each day I would stop in at the Mourning Glory for a cup of coffee and a muffin and to read my newspaper in a sun-drenched corner of the caf�. I remember Fielda, in those days, as being very solicitous and gracious to me, the coffee, piping hot, and the muffin sliced in half with sweet butter on the side. I must admit, I took this considerate service for granted, believing that Fielda treated all her patrons in this manner. It was not until one wintry morning, about a year after I started coming to the Mourning Glory, that Fielda stomped up to me, one hand on her ample hip, the other hand holding my cup of coffee.<br><br>"What," Fielda shrilly aimed at me, "does a girl have to do in order to get your attention?" She banged the cup down in front of me, my glasses leaping on my nose in surprise, coffee sloshing all over the table.<br><br>Before I could splutter a response, she had retreated and then reappeared, this time with my muffin that she promptly tossed at me. It bounced off my chest, flaky crumbs of orange poppy seed clinging to my tie. Fielda ran from the caf� and her mother, a softer, more careworn version of Fielda, sauntered up to me. Rolling her eyes heavenward, she sighed. "Go on out there and talk to her, Mr. Gregory. She's been pining over you for months.<br><br>Either put her out of her misery or ask her to marry you. I need to get some sleep at night."<br><br>I did go out after Fielda and we were married a month later.<br><br>Lying there in our bed, the August morning already sweeping my skin with its prickly heat, I twist around, find Fielda's slack cheek in the darkness and kiss it. I slide out of bed and out of the room. I stop at Petra's door. It is slightly open and I can hear the whir of her fan. I gently push the door forward and step into her room, a place so full of little girl whimsy that it never fails to make me pause. The carefully arranged collections of pinecones, acorns, leaves, feathers and rocks all expertly excavated from our backyard at the edge of Willow Creek Woods. The baby dolls, stuffed dogs and bears all tucked lovingly under blankets fashioned from washcloths and arranged around her sleeping form. The little girl perfume, a combination of lavender-scented shampoo, green grass and perspiration that holds only the enzymes of the innocent, overwhelms me every time I cross this threshold. My eyes begin to adjust to the dark and I see that Petra is not in her bed. I am not alarmed; Petra often has bouts of insomnia and skulks downstairs to the living room to watch television.<br><br>I, too, go downstairs, but very quickly I know that Petra is not watching television. The house is quiet, no droning voices or canned laughter. I walk briskly through each room, switching on lights, the living room&#x2014;no Petra. The dining room, the kitchen, the bathroom, my office&#x2014;no Petra. Back through the kitchen down to the basement&#x2014;no Petra. Rushing up the stairs to Fielda, I shake her awake.<br><br>"Petra's not in her bed," I gasp.<br><br>Fielda leaps from the bed and retraces the path I just followed, no Petra. I hurry out the back door and circle the house once, twice, three times. No Petra. Fielda and I meet back in the kitchen, and we look at one another helplessly. Fielda stifles a moan and dials the police.<br><br>We quickly pulled on clothes in order to make ourselves presentable to receive Deputy Sheriff Louis. Fielda continues to wander through each of the rooms, checking for Petra, looking through closets and under the stairs. "Maybe she went over to Calli's house," she says.<br><br>"At this time of the morning?" I ask. "What would possess her to do that? Maybe she was too hot and went outside to cool off and she lost track of time," I add. "Sit down, you're making me nervous. She is not in this house!" I say, louder than I should have. Fielda's face crumples and I go to her. "I'm sorry," I whisper, though her constant movement is making me nervous. "We'll go make coffee for when he arrives."<br><br>"Coffee? Coffee?" Fielda's voice is shrill and she is looking at me incredulously. "Let's just brew up some coffee so we can sit down and discuss how our daughter has disappeared. Disappeared right from her bedroom in the middle of the night! Would you like me to make him breakfast, too?<br><br>Eggs over easy? Or maybe waffles. Martin, our child is missing. Missing!" Her tirade ends in whimpers and I pat her on the back. I am no consolation to her, I know.<br><br>There is a rap at the front door and we both look to see Deputy Sheriff Louis, tall and rangy, his blond hair falling into his serious blue eyes. We invite him into our home, this man almost half my age, closer to Fielda's own, and sit him on our sofa.<br><br>"When did you see Petra last?" he asks us. I reach for Fielda's hand and tell him all that we know.<br><br><em>Antonia</em><br><br>I am being lifted from my sleep by the low rumble of what I think at first is thunder and I smile, my eyes still closed. A rainstorm, cool, plump drops. I think that maybe I should wake Calli and Ben. They both would love to go stomp around in the rain, to rinse away this dry, hot summer, if just for a few moments. I reach my hand over to Griff's side of the bed, empty and cooler than mine. It's Thursday, the fishing trip. Griff went fishing with Roger, no thunder, a truck? I roll over to Griff's side, absorb the brief coolness of the sheets and try to sleep, but continuous pounding, a solid banging on the front door, is sending vibrations through the floorboards. I swing my legs out of bed, irritated. It's only six o'clock, for Christ's sake. I pull on the shorts that I had dropped on the floor the night before and run my fingers through my bed-mussed hair. As I make my way through the hallway I see that Ben's door is tightly shut, as it normally is. Ben's room is his private fortress; I don't even try to go in there anymore. The only people he invites in are his school friends and his sister, Calli. This is surprising to me. I grew up in a family of four brothers and they let me enter their domain only when I forced my way in.<br><br></p><h2>Painter's Quick Reference - Santas &amp; Snowmen</h2><p><p><b>The perfect reference for painters!</b></p><p>Fast instruction and inspiration is at your fingertips!

Delicately precise yet filled with vigor and color, they present the prairie in its individual elements and--taken as a group that celebrates the hues and textures of tallgrass wildflowers and grasses--in its seasonal abundance. In The Elemental Prairie, the combination of George Olson&#39;s luminous drawings and John Madson&#39;s eloquent essay &#34;The Running Country&#34; encourages us to look at the prairie world with newly appreciative eyes. For some years Olson has focused almost exclusively on the grasses and wildflowers of the North American prairie, meticulously reproducing their elemental structures and colors while--proving once again that art can both imitate and enhance nature--emphasizing their magical loveliness. By painting certain species in their winter and summer &#34;plumages,&#34; he reveals the plants&#39; stark wintry framework as well as their more glorious warm-weath</p><p>George Olson recently retired from the faculty of the College of Wooster in Ohio, where he taught art from 1963 to 2000. His prairie plant studies have been shown widely in the U.S. and England, includ-ing more than thirty one-person exhibitions at such venues as the British Museum (Natural History), the Missouri Botanical Garden, the Chicago Botanic Garden, and the Royal Horticultural Society. John Madson (1923-1995) is considered the father of the modern prairie restoration movement; his books include Where the Sky Began (Iowa reprint 2004), Up on the River, Stories from Under the Sky, and Tallgrass Prairie."Artist George Olson has a special affinity for sketching plants of the vanishing American prairie. The fine results of his assiduous efforts are an excellent companion to John Madson's absorbing and informative essay on the North American prairie. Together, Olson and Madson are the ideal authors for this satisfying book, an aggregate of art, plants, and history."--James J. White, curator of art and principal research scholar, Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation<br><br>"Capturing the spirit of individual prairie plants in a way that is both moving and beautiful, George Olson here presents a sensitive and loving visual memoir of the plants that now survive mainly in small patches of natural grassland and glades. A book to be appreciated by all who love nature!"--Peter H. Raven, director, Missouri Botanical Garden<br><br>"George Olson and John Madson are the artist laureate and poet laureate of the prairie. They capture its beauty, complexity, and magic in ways that allow us to really see and feel and understand this uniquely American habitat and all that it represents. The Elemental Prairie's compelling mix of illustration and text make it one of the best natural history publications I have seen in a very long time."--Robert McCracken Peck, Senior Fellow and Librarian, Academy of Natural Sciences</p><h2>Brain Bugs: How the Brain&#39;s Flaws Shape Our Lives</h2><p><p><strong>A lively, surprising tour of our mental glitches and how they arise.</strong></p> With its trillions of connections, the human brain is more beautiful and complex than anything we could ever build, but it's far from perfect. Our memory is unreliable; we can't multiply large sums in our heads; advertising manipulates our judgment; we tend to distrust people who are different from us; supernatural beliefs and superstitions are hard to shake; we prefer instant gratification to long-term gain; and what we presume to be rational decisions are often anything but. Drawing on striking examples and fascinating studies, neuroscientist Dean Buonomano illuminates the causes and consequences of these "bugs" in terms of the brain's innermost workings and their evolutionary purposes. He then goes one step further, examining how our brains function-and malfunction-in the digital, predator-free, information-saturated, special effects-addled world that we have built for ourselves. Along the way, <em>Brain Bugs</em> gives us the tools to hone our cognitive strengths while recognizing our inherent weaknesses. 10 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Dean Buonomano is a professor of neurobiology and psychology at UCLA and a leading theorist on the neuroscience of time. His previous book, Brain Bugs: How the Brain&#x2019;s Flaws Shape Our Lives, was a Wall Street Journal bestseller."Writing a book about the hardware and software flaws of the human brain is an ingenious idea, and Buonomano has fully delivered on its promise. To a degree that is difficult for most of us to imagine, much less understand, our successes and failures, joys and sufferings, are the product of protein interactions and electrical changes taking place inside our heads. Brain Bugs is a remarkably accessible and engaging introduction to the neuroscience of the human condition."<br><strong>Sam Harris, <em>author of the New York Times bestsellers The Moral Landscape, Letter to a Christian Nation, and The End of Faith</em></strong> <p>"In Brain Bugs, Dean Buonomano has brilliantly pulled off what few psychological scientists can do. In elegant and clear writing, he masterfully conveys the astonishing capability of the human mind, along with its flaws and limitations. Only when we fully understand our &#x2018;bugs' will we be able to make the best financial, political, marital, and other decisions that are so important in shaping our lives."<br><strong>Elizabeth Loftus, <em>Distinguished Professor at the University of California, Irvine, and author of Eyewitness Testimony</em></strong></p> <p>"What a great book, filled with nuggets about how the brain works-and falters-and even some suggestions on how to put it to better use. Very enjoyable."<strong> <br>Joseph LeDoux, <em>New York University neuroscientist and author of The Emotional Brain and Synaptic Self. </em></strong><br><br>"He takes readers on a lively tour of systematic biases and errors in human thinking, citing examples that are staples of psychology courses and other popular books. What is new, however, is Buonomano&#x2019;s focus on the mechanisms of memory, especially its "associative architecture," as the main causes of the brain&#x2019;s bugs." <br><strong>Christopher Chabris</strong>, <em><strong>New York Times</strong></em> <br><br>"What makes the book all the more compelling is the lucidity with which Buonomano recognizes, amidst its weaknesses, the brain's insurmountable strengths, feats artificial intelligence is ages from reaching--most notably, its remarkable penchant for pattern-recognition and what Buonomano calls "the inherent and irrepressible ability of the brain to build connections and make associations." And whatever we may say of the future of the Internet and technology, even our most optimistic predictions pale in comparison to the remarkable information processes taking place, quite literally, under our very roofs. (And, if we're really keeping score, Buonomano points out that the brain's 90 billion neurons linked by 100 trillion synapses far surpass the web's 20 billion web pages connected by 1 trillion links.)"<br><strong>Maria Popova</strong>, <em><strong>The Atlantic<br><br></strong></em>"One of the things I liked most about this book was the way it leaps from neuron to brain and then to person and on to society and back again, making useful comparisons all the way. ... You won&#x2019;t eliminate the bugs in your brain by reading this book &#x2013; we have no delete button for memories or the emotions that lead us astray &#x2013; but you will understand them better."<br><strong>Susan Blackmore,</strong> <strong><em>Focus Magazine</em></strong></p></p><h2>Birth Ambassadors: Doulas and the Re-Emergence of Woman-Supported Birth in America</h2><p>Birth Ambassadors documents the social history of the emergence of doula care in the United States. What are doulas and where did they come from? Why do women become doulas? What does it mean to be a doula? Birth Ambassadors is the only book to fully answer these questions by connecting narrative accounts with critical sociological analysis of the dilemmas and issues embodied in doula history and practice. Based on historical research and interviews with currently practicing doulas and leaders in the field, Birth Ambassadors argues that the doula role is underpinned by ideological commitments to several overlapping and, at times, conflicting ideas around childbirth. These include an understanding of pregnancy and birth from the midwifery model, a belief in women&#39;s right to make informed choices regarding their health care, the need for patient/consumer advocacy and unconditional emotional support for women&#39;s choices about their births. Birth Ambassadors explores how this constellation of beliefs within doula practice represents an innovative yet problematic response within the maternity reform movement to empower women during and after childbirth. Doulas are ambassadors to the world of birth, highlighting women&#39;s emotional experience of birth in settings where beliefs and practices of the participants (the woman, her family, the nurses, midwives and obstetricians) are sometimes in conflict. For doulas to fulfill their goal of entering mainstream maternity care, they and their organizations face critical challenges.</p><p><b>Birth Ambassadors: </b><br><b>Doulas and the Re-Emergence of Woman-Supported Childbirth in America</b><br><br>By Christine H.

Wretched conditions, abusive white supervisors, poor education, and low wages locked most black workers into poverty. Then two sanitation workers were chewed up like garbage in the back of a faulty truck, igniting a public employee strike that brought to a boil long-simmering issues of racial injustice.<br><br> With novelistic drama and rich scholarly detail, Michael Honey brings to life the magnetic characters who clashed on the Memphis battlefield: stalwart black workers; fiery black ministers; volatile, young, black-power advocates; idealistic organizers and tough-talking unionists; the first black members of the Memphis city council; the white upper crust who sought to prevent change or conflagration; and, finally, the magisterial Martin Luther King Jr., undertaking a Poor People's Campaign at the crossroads of his life, vilified as a subversive, hounded by the FBI, and seeing in the working poor of Memphis his hopes for a better America. 16 pages of illustrations</p><p>Michael K. Honey, a former Southern civil rights and civil liberties organizer, is Haley Professor of Humanities at the University of Washington Tacoma, where he teaches labor, ethnic, and gender studies and American history. He is a Guggenheim Fellow and has won numerous research fellowships and book awards for his books on labor, race relations, and civil rights history, including the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award for Going Down Jericho Road. He lives in Tacoma with his wife, Pat Krueger.Reviewed by Kevin Boyle By the early months of 1968, Martin Luther King Jr.'s public ministry was in free fall. The great moral power he had unleashed in Birmingham and Selma, Ala. -- the nation made anew by peaceful protest -- had given way to a sickening cycle of violence: white terrorism in the South, black rioting in the North, war in Vietnam. As the brutality accelerated, King himself came under repeated attack. Advocates of Black Power dismissed him as too moderate. Many whites, angered by his criticism of Northern segregation and his opposition to the war in Southeast Asia, condemned him as too radical. Even some of his longstanding supporters wondered whether his campaigns on behalf of the dispossessed had become quixotic.<p>Then King went to Memphis. </p><p>In Going Down Jericho Road, Michael K. Honey painstakingly recreates the explosive situation King stepped into. On Feb. 12, 1968, Memphis's 1,300 sanitation workers, almost all of them African American, went on strike. They didn't ask for much: recognition of their union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; an agreement that the city would withhold union dues from workers' paychecks; a small pay raise; and improved safety standards. But for men who had always lived under the crushing weight of white supremacy, even such simple demands represented an exhilarating assertion of human rights. By walking off their jobs, the strikers were laying claim to the dignity and justice long denied them. </p><p>Memphis's conservative mayor, Henry Loeb, understood precisely what was happening. So he refused to negotiate. With the strike deadlocked, workers and their supporters took their protests to the streets. The city met mass marches with mass arrests. Repression triggered talk of armed resistance and sporadic acts of violence, much of it caused by young militants in the thrall of Black Power. By the time King arrived in Memphis on March 18, the sanitation strike had turned into a battle for the city's soul.</p><p>Honey devotes the second half of Going Down Jericho Road to King's month-long engagement with the strikers' struggle. A former union organizer turned labor historian at the University of Washington, Tacoma, Honey has a sure feel for the idealism that surged through the strike that spring. King's willingness to stand by the sanitation workers reinforced the sense of personal empowerment expressed on the strikers' picket signs. "I Am A Man," their slogan read. But the strike meant something to King as well, Honey says, something fundamentally important. He came to Memphis as a favor to local ministers, who hoped his presence would force the mayor to begin bargaining. He found there the makings of a new mass movement that pushed beyond civil rights to demand economic justice for the most marginal of Americans. With that vision before him, King rekindled the grand hopes that even he had felt slipping away. </p><p>Then the movement took an ugly turn. On March 28, King tried to lead some 10,000 marchers on a peaceful protest through downtown Memphis. But he couldn't control the teenagers at the tail end of the march, who started shattering shop windows. Looters grabbed whatever they could, the police attacked, and within moments King found himself in the midst of a riot. The incident turned into a public relations nightmare: The next day politicians, newspapers and television outlets across the country assailed the prophet of nonviolent resistance for loosing anarchy in the streets.</p><p>Worse was yet to come. King's advisers urged him to abandon the strike, but he knew that was impossible. "The Movement," he told them, "lives or dies in Memphis." After a week's respite from the city, King returned to Memphis on April 3 to solidify plans for yet another march. The following afternoon, while he was standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, he was shot in the head. As news of the murder spread, rioting swept across 125 cities. By week's end, 43 Americans had been killed and 20,000 arrested in the most fearsome wave of domestic disorder since the Civil War. </p><p>Though Honey recounts these events in chilling detail, he refuses to cast the strike in tragic tones. While the nation's inner cities burned, Memphis's sanitation workers remained peaceful, as King would have wanted them to be. Their resolve -- and intense national pressure -- forced Mayor Loeb finally to settle the dispute largely on the strikers' terms. But it was the struggle itself that really mattered, Honey contends, "because it opened people's eyes to the injustices of poverty and racism, and it gave them hope for a different world." That's an admirable sentiment. But it's hard to read Going Down Jericho Road without reaching the opposite conclusion. In Memphis, it wasn't hope that triumphed. It was brutal, bloody violence. </p><p>Reviewed by Kevin Boyle <br>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

At night, revenants crawl over the walls and bring plague and grief to this city of widows. Margriet de Vos learns she's a widow herself when her good-for-nothing husband comes home dead from the war. He didn't come back for her. The revenant who was her husband pulls a secret treasure of coins and weapons from under his floorboards and goes back through the mouth of the beast called Hell. Margriet killed her first soldier when she was 11. She's buried six of her seven children. She'll do anything for her daughter, even if it means raiding Hell itself to get her inheritance back. Margriet's daughter is haunted by a dead husband of her own, and blessed, or cursed, with an enchanted distaff that allows her to control the revenants and see the future. Together with a transgender man-at-arms who has unfinished business with the Chatelaine, a traumatized widow with a giant waterpowered forgehammer at her disposal, and a wealthy alderman's wife who escapes Bruges with her children, Margriet and Beatrix forge a raiding party like Hell has never seen.</p></p><p><p>Kate Heartfield is the author of dozens of speculative-fiction stories, including "The Seven O'Clock Man", which was longlisted for the Sunburst Award.

Heartfield&#x2019;s deep knowledge of art and literature from and about the medieval period allows her to approach her setting in a way that is simultaneously affectionate and subversive. Her engaging characters wander through a landscape in which horror and absurdity combine, seemingly rigid truths are deconstructed, and it very much matters who is telling the story."<br>&#x2015;2019 Sunburst Award Jury</p> <p>"<i>Armed in Her Fashion</i> is Kate Heartfield&#x2019;s debut novel, and what a strange, compelling, genre-bending debut it is. Part horror, part fantasy, part history, and part epic, it combines all of its elements into a commentary on gender, power, and patriarchy. . . . I really enjoyed <i>Armed in Her Fashion</i>. It&#x2019;s worth reading. I may, in fact, need to read it again: there are interesting layers in the thematic work that Heartfield&#x2019;s doing, and I&#x2019;m not convinced I caught them all in one sitting. In other words, I recommend it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Liz Bourke, Tor.com</p></p><h2>Krakatoa: The Day The World Exploded: August 27, 1883</h2><p><b>A New York Times Bestseller</b><p> The annihilation in 1883 of the volcano-island of Krakatoa was followed by an immense tsunami that killed nearly forty thousand people. Beyond the purely physical horrors of an event that has only very recently been properly understood, the eruption changed the world in more ways than could possibly be imagined.</p></p><p>It may seem a stretch to connect a volcanic eruption with civil and religious unrest in Indonesia today, but Simon Winchester makes a compelling case. <i>Krakatoa</i> tells the frightening tale of the biggest volcanic eruption in history using a blend of gentle geology and narrative history. Krakatoa erupted at a time when technologies like the telegraph were becoming commonplace and Asian trade routes were being expanded by northern European companies. This bustling colonial backdrop provides an effective canvas for the suspense leading up to August 27th, 1883, when the nearby island of Krakatoa would violently vaporize. Winchester describes the eruption through the eyes of its survivors, and readers will be as horrified and mesmerized as eyewitnesses were as the death toll reached nearly 40,000 (almost all of whom died from tsunamis generated by the unimaginably strong shock waves of the eruption). Ships were thrown miles inshore, endless rains of hot ash engulfed those towns not drowned by 100 foot waves, and vast rafts of pumice clogged the hot sea. The explosion was heard thousands of miles away, and the eruption's shock wave traveled around the world seven times. But the book's biggest surprise is not the riveting catalog of the volcano's effects; rather, it is Winchester's contention that the Dutch abandonment of their Indonesian colonies after the disaster left local survivors to seek comfort in radical Islam, setting the stage for a volatile future for the region. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><p> Simon Winchester's many books include <i>The Professor and the Madman</i>, <i>The Map That Changed the World</i>, <i>Krakatoa</i>, and <i>A Crack in the Edge of the World</i>. Each of these has been a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and has appeared on numerous best and notable lists. Mr. Winchester was made Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by HM The Queen in 2006. He lives in western Massachusetts. </p></p><h2>Lowside of the Road: A Life of Tom Waits</h2><p><p>With his trademark growl, carnival-madman persona, haunting music, and unforgettable lyrics, Tom Waits is one of the most revered and critically acclaimed singer-songwriters alive today. After beginning his career on the margins of the 1970s Los Angeles rock scene, Waits has spent the last thirty years carving out a place for himself among such greats as Bob Dylan and Neil Young. Like them, he is a chameleonic survivor who has achieved long-term success while retaining cult credibility and outsider mystique. But although his songs can seem deeply personal and somewhat autobiographical, fans still know very little about the man himself. Notoriously private, Waits has consistently and deliberately blurred the line between fact and fiction, public and private personas, until it has become impossible to delineate between truth and self-fabricated legend. <br><br><i>Lowside of the Road</i> is the first serious biography to cut through the myths and make sense of the life and career of this beloved icon. Barney Hoskyns has gained unprecedented access to Waits&#x2019;s inner circle and also draws on interviews he has done with Waits over the years. Spanning his extraordinary forty-year career from <i>Closing Time</i> to <i>Orphans</i>, from his perilous &#x201c;jazzbo&#x201d; years in 1970s LA to such shape-shifting albums as <i>Swordfishtrombones</i> and <i>Rain Dogs</i> to the Grammy Award winners of recent years, this definitive biography charts Waits&#x2019;s life and art step by step, album by album.<br><br>Barney Hoskyns has written a rock biography&#x2014;much like the subject himself&#x2014;unlike any other. It is a unique take on one of rock&#x2019;s great enigmas.</p></p><p><p><b>Barney Hoskyns </b>is cofounder and editorial director of the online rock-journalism library Rock&#x2019;s Backpages (www.rocksbackpages.com), and author of several books including <i>Across the Great Divide: The Band and America </i>(1993), <i>Hotel California: Singer-Songwriters and Cocaine Cowboys in the LA Canyons </i>(2005), and the newly reissued <i>Waiting for the Sun: A Rock and Roll History of Los Angeles</i>. A former U.S. correspondent for <i>Mojo</i>, Hoskyns writes for <i>Uncut</i>, the<i> Observer Music Monthly</i>, and other U.K. publications, and has contributed to <i>Vogue</i>,<i> Rolling Stone</i>, and <i>GQ</i>. He lives in southwest London.</p>When a celebrity not only refuses to cooperate with a would-be biographer but persuades most of his inner circle not to grant interviews either, the writer's task is much more daunting. In trying to account for the 40-year career of eccentric singer/songwriter (and occasional film actor) Tom Waits, Hoskyns (<i>Hotel California</i>) puts his subject's reluctance front and center, openly speculating on the rumors that Waits's wife has engineered his withdrawal from his early associates. The armchair psychology extends to Waits's idiosyncratic public persona, but is buttressed with interviews with as many people as Hoskyns could get to talk, a few conversations he had with Waits for magazine pieces and excerpts from other articles over the years. For the most part, Waits's musical transformation from hip troubadour to far-out maverick is well contextualized, but when Hoskyns's resources are stretched thin in this overlong book, his pronouncements become less compelling. Readers may not particularly care what the biographer thinks of Waits's last album, for example, nor need a complete set list from a random concert. Despite these problems, however, Hoskyns deserves credit for trying to give Waits the critical scrutiny his work deserves. <i>(Apr. 14)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Politics would be more collegial. Businesses would be more productive. And communities would be healthier. Empowering women would make the world a better place&#x2014;not because women are the same as men, but precisely because they are different.</p><p>Blending memoir, social history, and a call to action, Dee Dee Myers challenges us to imagine a not-too-distant future in which increasing numbers of women reach the top ranks of politics, business, science, and academia. </p><p>Reflecting on her own tenure in the Clinton administration and her work as a political analyst, media commentator, and former consultant to NBC's <em>The West Wing</em>, Myers assesses the crucial but long-ignored strengths that female leaders bring to the table. "Women tend to be better communicators, better listeners, better at forming consensus," Myers argues. In a highly competitive and increasingly fractious world, women possess the kind of critical problem-solving skills that are urgently needed to break down barriers, build understanding, and create the best conditions for peace.</p><p>Myers knows firsthand the responsibilities and rewards of taking on leadership roles traditionally occupied by men. At thirty-one, she was appointed White House press secretary to President Bill Clinton&#x2014;the first woman ever to hold the job. In a candid look at her years in Washington's political spotlight, she recalls the day-to-day challenge of confronting a press corps obsessed with more than just the president's policies. "Virtually every story written about me included observations about my earrings, my makeup, my clothes, my shoes. And then there was my hair."</p><p>Recalling the pressures&#x2014;both invited and imposed&#x2014;of her West Wing years, Myers offers a hard-hitting look at the challenges women must overcome and the traps they must avoid as they travel the path toward success. From pioneering research in the laboratory, to innovations in business, entertainment, and media, to friendships that transcend partisanship in the U.S. Senate, she describes how female participation in public life has already transformed the world in which we live.</p></p><p><p>Dee Dee Myers served as White House press secretary during Bill Clinton's first term. She was the first woman to hold that position. She is a contributing editor to <em>Vanity Fair</em>, a political analyst and commentator, and a lecturer on politics and women's issues. She lives with her husband and their children in Washington, D.C.</p>&#x201c;Just like Dee Dee Myers herself this jewel of a book is sober minded, funny, and most certainly timely. . . . Myers makes a spirited case that &#x201c;women power&#x201d; is the most neglected political recourse in our arid times.&#x201d; (Douglas Brinkley, New York Times bestselling author of The Great Deluge)</p><h2>Stravinsky and Balanchine: A Journey of Invention</h2><p>Igor Stravinsky and George Balanchine, among the most influential artists of the twentieth century, together created the music and movement for many ballet masterpieces. This book is the first full-length study of one of the greatest collaborations in history.<br>Drawing on extensive new research, Charles M. Joseph discusses the Stravinsky-Balanchine ballets against a rich contextual backdrop. He explores the background and psychology of the two men, the dynamics of their interactions, their personal and professional similarities and differences, and the political and historical circumstances that conditioned their work. He describes the dancers, designers, and sponsors with whom they worked. He explains the two men's approach to the creative process and the genesis of each of the collaborative ballets, demolishing much received wisdom on the subject. And he analyzes selected sections of music and dance, providing examples of Stravinsky's working sketches and other helpful illustrative materials.</p><p>"The book is written with exemplary clarity, and it is highly original, enjoyable to read, and genuinely interdisciplinary. There is both a music and a dance readership for it."&#x2014;Stephanie Jordan, Roehampton University of SurreyCharles M. Joseph is professor of music at Skidmore College.</p><h2>Architecture of the Old South: Virginia</h2><p>The first in-depth survey of Virginia&#39;s pre-Civil War historic buildings reveals numerous worthy and interesting structures, not just the most famous edifices. 300 illustrations.</p><p>Virginia was America's most prosperous and populous state in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and its architecture from this time reflects a high degree of sophistication and variety. In addition to Jefferson, architects from outside the region--Haviland, Parris, Walter, Lafever, Renwick, and Davis--were called in to design some of the state's most impressive structures. As the first comprehensive survey of Virginia's antebellum architecture, this volume is a welcome arrival. Lane has put together an immensely readable account, chronologically organized and illustrated with a wide range of historical photographs, architects' renderings, and floor plans.

These mercurial popes, such as Alexander VI, the infamous Borgia patriarch, and Julius 'Il Terrible' II, contributed to cultural achievements &#x2014; the Basilica of St. Peters and Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel &#x2014; through the sale of indulgences, and targeted heretics with Inquisitions and witchhunts. In the midst of this explosion of great culture and violent debasement, Alexander VI, father of the ruthless Cesare and jezebel Lucrezia, came to be seen as the embodiment of this iniquity. But Gerard Noel shows that Alexander's legacy was tainted by false confessions and historical myth. In fact, Alexander created the blueprint for reform &#x2014; the first of its kind &#x2014; that would eventually lead to the Counter-Reformation. In his survey of the colorful reigns of the seventeen Renaissance Popes and his examination of the great Borgia myth, Noel brings to light the true legacy &#x2014; political, artistic, religious &#x2014; of an extraordinary time.</p><p>The Hon. <b>Gerard Noel</b> was the Editor of the <i>Catholic Herald</i> and is now its Editorial Director.

Are those couples who stay together necessarily happy? <br><br>No, not necessarily. In fact, many marriages that remain intact are far less than ideal. A mere seven percent are <i>really</i> good--in fact, exceptional. These couples have much greater than average passion, happiness, longevity, and fulfillment.<br><br>But if less-than-exceptional marriages are made up of men who are supposedly from Mars and women who are supposedly from Venus, what planet do exceptional husbands and wives come from? What are the secrets of exceptional couples. . .and what can they teach us?<br><br>Marriage therapist Gregory K. Popcak believes that ways of relating employed by exceptional couples can benefit all marriages. In <i>The Exceptional Seven Percent,</i> he looks at the most successful couples and exposes their secrets. Each chapter examines in detail the basic characteristics of exceptional couples, including:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Developing a marital imperative<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Setting and achieving emotional goals<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Cultivating exceptional levels of fidelity, loving, service, rapport, negotiation, gratitude, joy, and sexuality<br>Through anecdotes, analyses, exercises, and quizzes, you'll learn what your weaknesses are and how you can begin to make positive changes. You have the power to turn your marriage into the most precious thing in your life. Why settle for anything less? <br><br><b>Gregory K. Popcak, MSW,</b> is a licensed psychotherapist who developed and now runs marriage preparation and enrichment seminars. He also writes regular marriage and family columns for popular and professional journals and runs a private practice. He lives outside Pittsburgh.</p><p><b>Gregory Popcak </b>founded the Pastoral Solutions Institute in 1999 with the goal of assisting Catholic couples achieve a strong, faith-filled marriage and family. His published works include <i>The Exceptional Seven Percent: The Nine Secrets of the World&#x2019;s Happiest Couples</i> and&nbsp;<i>When Divorce Is Not an Option: How to Heal Your Marriage and Nurture Lasting Love</i>.With a mature style that is intellectually appealing, Popcak shares his inspiring conviction that marriage can be a powerfully actualizing enterprise. Drawing on the results of several marriage studies, he contends that while most marriages are "conventional" (read: average), and some are even "impoverished," a fortunate 7% are "exceptional." Having a marriage in the exceptional category, says Popcak, requires a commitment to live your life according to a "Marital Imperative," a motto of sorts that identifies the most important qualities that each partner strives to manifest in life through the marriage. This imperative then becomes the basis for all decision making, including even minor daily activities. In this way, exceptional couples exhibit greater congruence between their actions and beliefs and stand a much greater chance of faithfully exemplifying their most desired personal qualities. Like Stephen Covey and Abraham Harold Maslow, Popcak focuses on the refinement of peak performance. Offering engaging exercises and checklists to help readers clarify their aims and progress along his theoretical pathway to self-actualization, he challenges conventional couples to recognize how much better their marriage could be with a few attitude adjustments and priority clarifications. Self-improvement aficionados will find his approach a welcome and refreshing addition to the genre. Illustrations not seen by PW.

French artist (and author of <i>The Machine Embroiderer's Workbook</i>, 1992, and <i>Encyclopedia of Machine Embroidery</i>, 2003) Val Holmes re-creates the 1970s concept of recycling into a host of techniques and ideas and a handful of projects that experienced stitchers will welcome. It's heavy on the ideas, such as dismantling an embellished garment and reassembling it for a more perfect, uniquely decorated fit; or the use of patchwork in inventing items fabricated out of plastics or metal. It also emphasizes a variety of techniques, many taking advantage of miracle materials like Aquabond (a water-soluble fabric with one sticky side) and crystal strands, synthetic fibers that fuse together when ironed. Full-color photographs of finished recyclables enhance the half-dozen projects--a cushion, makeup bag, concertina book--giving needleworkers inspiration that will last a literal lifetime." - Barbara Jacobs</p><p>Copyright (c) American Library Association.

Especially when the drug is Can-D, which translates its users into the idyllic world of a Barbie-esque character named Perky Pat. When the mysterious Palmer Eldritch arrives with a new drug called Chew-Z, he offers a more addictive experience, one that might bring the user closer to God. But in a world where everyone is tripping, no promises can be taken at face value. &nbsp; This Nebula Award nominee is one of Philip K. Dick&#x2019;s enduring classics, at once a deep character study, a dark mystery, and a tightrope walk along the edge of reality and illusion.<br><br>Over a career that spanned three decades, Philip K. Dick (1928&#x2013;1982) wrote 121 short stories and 45 novels, establishing himself as one of the most visionary authors of the twentieth century. His work is included in the Library of America and has been translated into more than twenty-five languages. Eleven works have been adapted to film, including <i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall</i>, <i>Minority Report</i>, and <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>.<br><br>In this wildly disorienting funhouse of a novel, populated by God-like--or perhaps Satanic--takeover artists and corporate psychics, Philip K. Dick explores mysteries that were once the property of St. Paul and Aquinas. His wit, compassion, and knife-edged irony make <b>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</b> moving as well as genuinely visionary.</p><h2>Trees: A quick reference guide to trees of North America (Macmillan field guides)</h2><p>Identifies more than two hundred species of trees, and includes information on range, habitat, and characteristics for each tree</p><p></p><h2>1003 Salt &amp; Pepper Shakers: With Values (A Schiffer Book for Collectors)</h2><p>This third volume by Larry Carey and Sylvia Tompkins focuses on character salt and pepper shakers.

The story is narrated by the president of the fictitious Republic of Britannula, an ex-British colony on an imaginary island near New Zealand. The original young settlers, led by their president, adopt a plan called the Fixed Period. Under this plan, the island would be relieved of the burden of an aging population by calling for compulsory euthanasia for citizens reaching the age of 67. Opposition to the plan grows as the time approaches for &#x201c;depositing&#x201d; the first citizen in the euthanasia park, and the elderly citizens successfully persuade the British government to send a gunboat armed with a powerful new weapon to reannex the country.<br> <br> Trollope&#x2019;s satiric portrayal of the statisticians who calculate the savings to be realized by putting the old people away before they become an expensive catastrophic burden, and the ironic presentation of the narrator&#x2019;s justification of euthanasia by appeal to Christian practice and doctrine, will delight contemporary readers. Trollope&#x2019;s strong dislike of government bureaucracy is evident throughout, as is his awareness of the dangers to the world of an imagined weapon of destruction not unlike (in its effect) the atomic bomb.<br> <br> In making accessible the complete text of this work with corrections from the original manuscript, Super has performed an invaluable service for Trollope scholars and enthusiasts.<br> </p></p><p>As young adult, Trollope endured seven years of poverty in the General Post Office in London before accepting a better-paying position as postal surveyor in Banagher, Ireland in 1841. The years in Ireland formed the basis of his second career delineating clerical life in small cathedral towns.</p><h2>Collected Poems</h2><p>A revised edition of this major writer&#39;s complete poetical work&#34;And I who was walkingwith the earth at my waist,saw two snowy eaglesand a naked girl.The one was the otherand the girl was neither.&#34;--from &#34;Qasida of the Dark Doves&#34;Federico Garc�a Lorca is the greatest poet of twentieth-century Spain and one of the world&#39;s most influential modernist writers. Christopher Maurer, a leading Lorca scholar and editor, has substantially revised FSG&#39;s earlier edition of the collected poems of this charismatic and complicated figure, who--as Maurer says in his illuminating Introduction--&#34;spoke unforgettably of all that most interests us: the otherness of nature, the demons of personal identity and artistic creation, sex, childhood, and death.&#34;</p><p>Long regarded as one of the premier Spanish modernists, Federico Garc�a Lorca's newly revised <i>Collected Poems</i> is a welcome contribution to this outstanding poet's prolific body of work. This bilingual edition includes many recently discovered poems and revised translations, updating the completeness of the verse produced by Lorca during his short life (he died at 38). Lorca's poetry is quirky, playful, not only filled with orange groves and olive trees, but a strange, physical world where a river has "garnet whiskers" or there exists a "recumbent sky" or "mummified ocean." Lorca wrote love poems, though we can never be sure what exactly is desired. His poetry isn't abstract, but the images are sometimes a bit out of reach--if anything, he tried to give the abstract a physical presence. For example, a lovers' exchange is given dimension in "The Poet Tells the Truth": "Let the skein never end / of I love you you love me, ever burnt / with decrepit sun and old moon." What Lorca wrote of a friend gored by a bull in "Lament for Ignacio S�nchez Mej�as" seems applicable to his poetry generally: "I sing of his elegance in words that moan / and I remember a sad breeze in the olive grove." <i>Collected Poems</i> is an important addition to any poetry collection, especially for those unfamiliar with Lorca or those who wish to read the poems in their original Spanish. <i>--Michael Ferch</i><p><b>Federico Garc�a Lorca </b>was born in 1898 in Fuente Vaqueros, a few miles outside Granada in the province of Andalusia, southern Spain. From an early age he was fascinated by Spain's mixed heritage, adapting its ancient folk songs, ballads, lullabies, and flamenco music into poems and plays. By the age of thirty, he had published five books of poems, culminating in 1928 with<i> Gypsy Ballads,</i> which brought him far-reaching fame. In 1929-30 he studied in New York City, where he wrote the poems&#x2015;among his most socially engaging and compelling&#x2015;that were to be published posthumously (and famously) as <i>Poet in New York</i>. Upon returning to Spain he devoted much of his attention to theater, "the poetry which rises from the page . . . and becomes human." In 1936, at the outset of the Spanish Civil War, he was shot to death by anti-Republican rebels in Franco's army, and his books were banned and destroyed.</p><p><b>Christopher Maurer</b>, the editor of Garc�a Lorca's <i>Selected Verse, Poet in New York,</i> and other works, is the author of numerous books and articles on Spanish poetry. He is head of the Department of Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese at the University of Illinois in Chicago.</p></p><h2>Depraved</h2><p>The disturbing story of H. H. Holmes, the criminal mind behind the infamous &#34;Castle of Horror&#34; torture house, describes the ways in which he deceived and murdered his victims. Reprint.</p><p>Herman Mudgett, who called himself Dr. H. H. Holmes, seemed the epitome of the late 19th century "Golden Age": he was a well-dressed, charismatic, self-made entrepreneur (think Andrew Carnegie). Unfortunately for his many victims, he was also a liar, bigamist, debtor, con man, and murderer. The setting for several of his murders was the bizarre urban "castle" he built in Chicago--a ramshackle construction with mazelike corridors, soundproof rooms, sealed vaults, oversized furnaces, and chutes leading down to the cellar. Holmes's undoing was an insurance scam in which he planned to use a corpse supplied by a doctor to fake his partner's death, but ended up killing the partner, his wife, and his five children. <i>The Boston Book Review</i> wrote, "[Harold] Schechter's account of this charming, repulsive monster is both an astonishing piece of popular history as well as a near clinical analysis of as sinister a killer as this country has ever produced." <br> Also recommended: Schechter's books about Albert Fish (<i>Deranged</i>) and Ed Gein (<i>Deviant</i>).Harold Schechter is a professor at Queens College, the City University of New York, where he teaches courses in American literature and culture.</p><h2>The Moral Intelligence of Children</h2><p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the bestselling The Spiritual Life of Children now explores how to develop character in children, from infancy through the teenage years. During three stages in the &#34;moral archaeology of childhood, &#34; Coles shows how to spot moral crossroads, and what to do about them.</p><p>Despite our society's astounding success in securing material comfort and security, the moral crisis of modernity continues to be a thorn in our sides. Why is it that our superior educational system doesn't churn out superior moral adults? Robert Coles takes up where Daniel Goleman left off in his groundbreaking <i>Emotional Intelligence</i> and shows us how children learn moral behavior and how we can better teach them. Instead of theoretical essays filled with statistics and dry case studies, Coles's style of addressing the reader through the use of anecdotes and ruminations makes for a comfortable, engaging read.<b>Robert Coles </b>is professor of psychiatry and medical humanities at the Harvard Medical School and a research psychiatrist for the Harvard University Health Services. He has written over 50 books, including the Pulitzer prize-winning five-volume <i>Children of Crisis</i> and the bestselling <i>The Spiritual Life of Children</i>.

Harding Jr. could afford the expensive hobby of collecting art and used his keen eye for medieval and Renaissance armor and weapons to do just that. The Harding collection was eventually donated to the Art Institute of Chicago, and today it is that museum's most popular holding. This volume showcases those pieces in large and lavish photos and illustrations within a layout that is inviting and balanced. In his accompanying text, Karcheski, the curator of arms and armor at the Higgins Armory Museum, puts these examples and the general subject of medieval armor and weapons into context for the general reader. Though highly readable and inviting, the lack of an index and bibliography drastically limits the book's research value.

Drawn from Indian Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism as well as from all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism, some will impress with their beautiful poetry and powerful imagery; others with their profound power of instruction. Still others share personal advice for life that seems to come directly from the mouth of the author, and some serve as immediate and profound practice instructions. Several are just delightfully unconventional, even outrageous, letting in fresh air on petrified views or musty traditions. Most of them are simply unknown precious gems, which deserve a wider audience. Each of the works is preceded by a brief introduction and a short biography of its author. Many of these are legendary accounts of supernatural feats edifying examples for students on the same spiritual path, meant to expand their limited outlook with &#x201c;mind-blowing&#x201d; stories. Miraculous deeds, magnificent songs, and pithy instructions distinguish this collection assembled by the Buddhist scholar and translator Karl Brunnh�lzl, whose years of work among dharma texts and his skill as a translator yield a rich mine of teachings all chosen for their ability to speak directly to the heart.</p><p>Karl Brunnh�lzl, M.D., was trained as a physician and also studied Tibetology. He received his systematic training in Tibetan language and Buddhist philosophy and practice at the Marpa Institute for Translators, founded by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche. Since 1989 he has been a translator and interpreter from Tibetan into English. His present involvement is mainly with the Nitartha Institute as a teacher and translator."Essential teachings. . . . The deepest insights are presented here straight from the heart. I consider this a great contribution to the study of Buddhism."&#x2014;Ringu Tulku <br><br>"<i>Straight from the Heart</i> is a priceless garland of Mahayana and Vajrayana literary gems that were previously difficult to locate. . . . Beautifully translated. . . . All communicate the singular power and beauty of the Dharma and undoubtedly will awaken or deepen faith in the reader as well as instruct and delight. . . . Brunnh�lzl&#x2019;s thoroughness in presenting these rare and inspiring materials can be gauged from the fact that the book contains well over one thousand footnotes furnishing further details both for the general reader and scholars.&nbsp;<i>Straight from the Heart</i> has an almost magical quality; it makes one feel as though one were sitting in the presence of all those wonderful masters."&#x2014;Georg Feuerstein, PhD <br><br>"In the preface to <i>Straight from the Heart: Buddhist Pith Instructions</i> the translator Karl Brunnh�lzl aptly compares his new anthology to a box of fine chocolates. There is a tremendous variety within the collection, and as with chocolates these unique and rich poems, songs, and pithy treatises are best appreciated one or two at a time. . . . For readers who enjoy a book that may be repeatedly dipped into for inspiration, <i>Straight from the Heart</i> is a very deep well indeed. Brunnh�lzl strives for a balance of precision and clarity in his translations that make these esoteric instructions more accessible, and his commentaries contextualize the verses just enough without burying them in too much explanation."&#x2014;<i>Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly</i> <br><br>"<i>Straight from the Heart: Buddhist Pith Instructions</i> is an exciting new collection of poetry, songs, meditation, instructions, and philosophical works by Indian and Tibetan Buddhist masters, much of which has previously been unavailable in Western languages. The eminently capable translator Karl Brunnh�lzl has made his selections from the writings of such famous teachers as Nagarjuna Asanga and the Karmapas of Tibet as well as from those of lesser known teachers. Each selection is prefaced by an introduction and a biographical sketch of its author and is copiously annotated. The result is a compendium of profound and witty writings that will delight, inform, and inspire all who are interested in the Buddhist spiritual path."&#x2014;Elizabeth Callahan, editor and translator of <i>The Treasury of Knowledge, Book Six, Part Three: Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy</i> <br><br>"Well presented. . . .

But it's true: this is indeed one of the most important and influential books ever written, and it is one of the very few groundbreaking works of science that is truly readable.<p> To a certain extent it suffers from the Hamlet problem--it's full of clich�s! Or what are now clich�s, but which Darwin was the first to pen. Natural selection, variation, the struggle for existence, survival of the fittest: it's all in here.</p><p> Darwin's friend and "bulldog" T.H. Huxley said upon reading the <i>Origin</i>, "How extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that." Alfred Russel Wallace had thought of the same theory of evolution Darwin did, but it was Darwin who gathered the mass of supporting evidence--on domestic animals and plants, on variability, on sexual selection, on dispersal--that swept most scientists before it. It's hardly necessary to mention that the book is still controversial: Darwin's remark in his conclusion that "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history" is surely the pinnacle of British understatement. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>Jim Endersby&#39;s major new scholarly edition debunks some of the myths that surround Darwin&#39;s book, and expores how it was originally written, published and read.

Prepared especially with the non-specialist reader in mind, <i>Christ and the Future</i> expertly summarizes the Bible's teaching about the last things. The Christ-centred nature of the biblical teaching on the future is the main emphasis throughout, as the author shows us the future of the individual, the church, and, indeed, the whole universe. <br>Dr Venema s fine study is both comprehensive and careful. He is thoroughly biblical; he is also honest and fair in dealing with the variety of eschatological positions that are current in the Christian church. He does not shrink from tackling the hard questions which arise. Nor is he intimidated by the heavy artillery behind some of the views which he believes to be unbiblical. Furthermore, his commitment to serve the church, coupled with his background in pastoral ministry, guarantees that his exposition, even of complex issues, is expressed in a way that the average Christian should be able to follow.<br>For these reasons and others, I believe that you will find the study on which you are about to embark both intellectually satisfying and spiritually enriching. -- <strong>Sinclair B.

"This addition to Myrick's renowned series on Arizona railroads covers the great copper operation at Jerome, and a number of roads in the northern part of the state, including the still-operating Grand Canyon Railway. The Grand Canyon trackage was for many years a Santa Fe branch, and serves a tourist railroad today. Both the construction history, as well as the story of the line's revival in the 1990s, are thoroughly covered here. "Jerome was served by four railroads at various times, most notably the Verde Tunnel &amp; Smelter Railroad, a property of United Verde Copper Company, the primary mining producer at Jerome. Also noteworthy was the United Verde &amp; Pacific narrow gauge, which has its own chapter here, as does the United Verde Extension Railroad. Both are part of the complex railroad history of the Jerome area. "Another road serving the Jerome area was the Verde Valley Railway, long a Santa Fe branch, and active today as both the Arizona Central (for freight) and Verde Canyon (tourist trips). Thoroughly documented here are several shorter-lived railroads which served mining camps, including the Arizona &amp; Swansea, Arizona &amp; Utah, the Mohave &amp; Milltown, and the narrow gauge line serving Ryan. Notable occurences in the mining camps are described too. Also presented are the modern coal-hauling roads, the Coronado and the Black Mesa &amp; Lake Powell railroads. " Even some of the famous unbuilt railroad proposals, like the Arizona Northern and the Intermountain, St. George &amp; Grand Canyon, have their place in the story, and their history is here. As is typical of Myrick's work, these railroad histories encompass the histories of the towns and regions they served, providing a lively and detailed view of the history of pioneer Arizona.</p><p></p><h2>Leading Minds: An Anatomy Of Leadership</h2><p>Drawing on his groundbreaking work on intelligence and creativity, Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner, developer of the theory of Multiple Intelligences, offers fascinating revelations about the mind of the leader and his or her followers.

There was a pleasantly satisfied breakfast taste in her mouth of bacon and coffee and possibly croissants. She lifted her chin and the morning sun shone so brightly on the water, she had to squint through spangles of light to see her feet in front of her. Her toenails were each painted a different color. Red. Gold. Purple. Funny. The nail polish hadn&#x2019;t been applied very well. Blobby and messy. Someone else was floating in the water right next to her. Someone she liked a lot, who made her laugh, with toenails painted the same way. The other person waggled multicolored toes at her companionably, and she was filled with sleepy contentment. Somewhere in the distance, a man&#x2019;s voice shouted, &#x201c;Marco?&#x201d; and a chorus of children&#x2019;s voices cried back, &#x201c;Polo!&#x201d; The man called out again, &#x201c;Marco, Marco, Marco?&#x201d; and the voices answered, &#x201c;Polo, Polo, Polo!&#x201d; A child laughed; a long, gurgling giggle, like a stream of soap bubbles. A voice said quietly and insistently in her ear, &#x201c;Alice?&#x201d; and she tipped back her head and let the cool water slide silently over her face.<br>Tiny dots of light danced before her eyes.<br>Was it a dream or a memory?<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know!&#x201d; said a frightened voice. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see it happen!&#x201d;<br>No need to get your knickers in a knot.<br>The dream or memory or whatever it was dissolved and vanished like a reflection on water, and instead fragments of thought began to drift through her head, as if she were waking up from a long, deep sleep, late on a Sunday morning.<br>Is cream cheese considered a soft cheese?<br>It&#x2019;s not a hard cheese.<br>It&#x2019;s not . . .<br>. . . hard at all.<br>So, logically, you would think . . .<br>. . . something.<br>Something logical.<br>Lavender is lovely.<br>Logically lovely.<br>Must prune back the lavender!<br>I can smell lavender.<br>No, I can&#x2019;t.<br>Yes, I can.<br>That&#x2019;s when she noticed the pain in her head for the first time. It hurt on one side, a lot, as if someone had given her a good solid thwack with a baseball bat.<br>Her thoughts sharpened. What was this pain in the head all about? Nobody had warned her about pain in her head. She had a whole list of peculiar symptoms to be prepared for: heartburn, a taste like aluminum foil in your mouth, dizziness, extreme tiredness&#x2014;but nothing about a hammering ache at the side of your head. That one should really have been mentioned, because it was very painful. Of course, if she couldn&#x2019;t handle a run-of-the mill headache, well then . . .<br>The scent of lavender seemed to be coming and going, like a gentle breeze.<br>She let herself drift again.<br>The best thing would be to fall back asleep and return to that lovely dream with the water and the multicolored toenails.<br>Actually, maybe someone had mentioned headaches and she forgot? Yes, they had! Headaches, for heaven&#x2019;s sake! Really bad ones. Fabulous.<br>So much to remember. No soft cheeses or smoked salmon or sushi because of the risk of that disease she never even knew existed. Listeria. Something to do with bacteria. Hurts the baby. That&#x2019;s why you weren&#x2019;t allowed to eat leftovers. One bite of a leftover chicken drumstick could kill the baby. The brutal responsibilities of parenthood.<br>For now, she would just go back to sleep. That was the best thing.<br>Listeria.<br>Wisteria.<br>The wisteria over the side fence is going to look stunning if it ever gets around to flowering.<br>Listeria, wisteria.<br>Ha. Funny words.<br>She smiled, but her head really did hurt a lot. She was trying to be brave.<br>&#x201c;Alice? Can you hear me?&#x201d;<br>The lavender smell got stronger again. A bit sickly sweet.<br>Cream cheese is a spreadable cheese. Not too soft, not too hard, just right. Like the baby bear&#x2019;s bed.<br>&#x201c;Her eyelids are fluttering. Like she&#x2019;s dreaming.&#x201d;<br>It was no use. She couldn&#x2019;t get back to sleep, even though she felt exhausted, as if she could sleep forever. Were all pregnant women walking around with aching heads like this? Was the idea to toughen them up for labor pains? When she got up, she would check it out in one of the baby books.<br>She always forgot how pain was so upsetting. Cruel. It hurt your feelings. You just wanted it to stop, please, right now. Epidurals were the way to go. One epidural for my headache, please. Thank you.<br>&#x201c;Alice, try and open your eyes.&#x201d;<br>Was cream cheese even cheese? You didn&#x2019;t put a dollop of cream cheese on a cheese platter. Maybe cheese didn&#x2019;t actually mean cheese in the context of cream cheese. She wouldn&#x2019;t ask the doctor about it, just in case it&#x2019;s an embarrassing &#x201c;Oh, Alice&#x201d; mistake.<br>She couldn&#x2019;t get comfortable. The mattress felt like cold concrete. If she wriggled over, she could nudge Nick with her foot until he sleepily rolled over and pulled her to him in a big warm bear hug. Her human hot water bottle.<br>Where was Nick? Had he already got up? Maybe he was making her a cup of tea.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try and move, Alice. Just stay still and open your eyes, sweetie.&#x201d;<br>Elisabeth would know about the cream cheese. She&#x2019;d snort in her bigsisterly way and be precise. Mum wouldn&#x2019;t have a clue. She&#x2019;d be stricken. She&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Oh dear, oh no! I&#x2019;m sure I ate soft cheeses when I was pregnant with you girls! They didn&#x2019;t know about that sort of thing back then.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d talk on and on and worry that Alice had accidentally broken a rule. Mum believed in rules. So did Alice actually.<br>Frannie wouldn&#x2019;t know but she&#x2019;d research it, proudly, using her new computer, in the same way that she used to help Alice and Elisabeth find information for school projects in her Encyclopedia Britannica.<br>Her head really did hurt.<br>Presumably this was only the squidgiest fraction of how much labor would hurt. So that was just great.<br>It was not as if she&#x2019;d actually eaten any cream cheese that she could remember.<br>&#x201c;Alice? Alice!&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t even really like cream cheese.<br>&#x201c;Has someone called an ambulance?&#x201d;<br>There was that smell of lavender again.<br>Once, when they were undoing their seat belts, Nick said (in answer to some fishing-for-compliments thing she&#x2019;d just said), &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous, you goose, you know I&#x2019;m bloody besotted with you.&#x201d;<br>She opened the car door and felt sunshine on her legs and smelled the lavender she&#x2019;d planted by the front door.<br>Bloody besotted.<br>It was a moment of lavender-scented bliss, after grocery shopping.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming. I called triple zero! That&#x2019;s the first time in my life I&#x2019;ve ever called triple zero! I felt all self-conscious. I nearly called 911 like an American. I actually punched in the nine. There&#x2019;s proof I watch too much television.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s not, like, serious. I mean, I couldn&#x2019;t, like, get sued or anything, could I?&#x201d;<br>Was that talkback radio she could hear? She hated talkback radio. The callers were always appalled by something. Alice said once that she&#x2019;d never been appalled by anything. Elisabeth said that was appalling.<br>&#x201c;Alice, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Alice?&#x201d;<br>Sultana, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Sultana?<br>Every night, before they went to sleep, Nick talked to the baby through an empty toilet roll pressed to Alice&#x2019;s stomach. He&#x2019;d heard this idea on some radio show. They said that way the baby would learn to recognize the father&#x2019;s voice as well as the mother&#x2019;s.<br>&#x201c;Ahoy!&#x201d; he&#x2019;d call. &#x201c;Can you hear me, Sultana? This is your father speaking!&#x201d; They&#x2019;d read that the baby was the size of a sultana by now. So that&#x2019;s what they called it. Only in private, of course; they were cool parents-to-be. No sappiness in public.<br>The Sultana said it was fine, thanks, Dad, bit bored at times, but doing okay. Apparently he wished his mum would stop eating all that boring green shit and have a pizza for a change. &#x201c;Enough with the rabbit food!&#x201d; he demanded.<br>It seemed the Sultana was most likely to be a boy. He just seemed to have a masculine personality. The little rogue. They both agreed on this.<br>Alice would lie back and look at the top of Nick&#x2019;s head. There were a few shiny silvery strands. She didn&#x2019;t know if he knew about them, so she didn&#x2019;t mention them. He was thirty-two. The silver strands made her eyes blur. All those wacky pregnancy hormones.<br>Alice never talked out loud to the baby. She spoke to it in her mind, shyly, when she was in the bath (not too hot&#x2014;so many rules). &#x201c;Hey there, Baby,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d think to herself, and then she&#x2019;d be so overwhelmed by the wonder of it she&#x2019;d splash the water with the flats of her palms like a kid thinking about Christmas. She was turning thirty soon, with a terrifying mortgage and a husband and a baby on the way, but she didn&#x2019;t feel that different from when she was fifteen.<br>Except, there were no moments of bliss after grocery shopping when she was fifteen. She hadn&#x2019;t met Nick yet. Her heart still had to be broken a few times before he could turn up and superglue it together with words like &#x201c;besotted.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Alice? Are you okay? Please open your eyes.&#x201d;<br>It was a woman&#x2019;s voice. Too loud and strident to ignore. It dragged her up into consciousness and wouldn&#x2019;t let her go.<br>It was a voice that gave Alice a familiar irritated itch of a feeling, like too-tight stockings.<br>This person did not belong in her bedroom.<br>She rolled her head to one side. &#x201c;Ow!&#x201d;<br>She opened her eyes.<br>There was a blur of unrecognizable colors and shapes. She couldn&#x2019;t even see the bedside cabinet to reach for her glasses. Her eyes must be getting worse.<br>She blinked, and blinked again, and then, like a sharpening telescope, everything came into focus. She was looking at someone&#x2019;s knees. How funny.<br>Knobbly pale knees.<br>She lifted her chin a fraction.<br>&#x201c;There you are!&#x201d;<br>It was Jane Turner of all people, from work, kneeling next to her. Her face was flushed and she had strands of sweaty hair pasted to her forehead. Her eyes looked tired. She had a soft, pudgy neck Alice had never noticed before. She was wearing a T-shirt with huge sweat marks and shorts and her arms were thin and white with dark freckles. Alice had never seen so much of Jane&#x2019;s body before. It was embarrassing. Poor old Jane.<br>&#x201c;Listeria, wisteria,&#x201d; said Alice, to be humorous.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re delirious,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try and sit up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hmmph,&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t want to sit up.&#x201d; She had a feeling she wasn&#x2019;t in bed; she seemed to be lying flat on her back on a cool laminated floor. Was she drunk? Had she forgotten she was pregnant and got deliriously drunk?<br>Her obstetrician was an urbane man who wore a bow tie and had a round face disconcertingly similar to that of one of Alice&#x2019;s ex-boyfriends. He said he didn&#x2019;t have a problem with &#x201c;say, an aperitif followed by one glass of wine with dinner.&#x201d; Alice thought an aperitif must be a particular brand of drink. (&#x201c;Oh, Alice,&#x201d; said Elisabeth.) Nick explained that an aperitif was a predinner drink. Nick came from an aperitif-drinking family. Alice came from a family with one dusty bottle of Baileys sitting hopefully in the back of the pantry behind the tins of spaghetti. In spite of what the obstetrician said, she&#x2019;d only had a half a glass of champagne since she&#x2019;d done the pregnancy test and she felt guilty about that even though everybody kept saying it was fine.<br>&#x201c;Where am I?&#x201d; asked Alice, terrified of the answer. Was she in some seedy nightclub? How could she explain to Nick that she forgot she was pregnant?<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re at the gym,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;You fell and knocked yourself out. Gave me an absolute heart attack, although I was sort of grateful for the excuse to stop.&#x201d;<br>The gym? Alice didn&#x2019;t go to gyms. Had she woken up drunk in a gym?<br>&#x201c;You lost your balance,&#x201d; said a sharp, jolly voice. &#x201c;It was quite a fall! Gave us all a shock, you silly sausage! We&#x2019;ve called an ambulance, so don&#x2019;t you worry, we&#x2019;ve got professional help on the way!&#x201d;<br>Kneeling next to Jane was a thin, coffee-tanned girl with a bleachedblond ponytail, shiny Lycra shorts, and a cropped red top with the words SPIN CRAZY emblazoned across it. Alice felt instant dislike for her. She didn&#x2019;t like being called a silly sausage. It offended her dignity. One of Alice&#x2019;s faults, according to her sister Elisabeth, was a tendency to take herself too seriously.<br>&#x201c;Did I faint?&#x201d; asked Alice hopefully. Pregnant women fainted. She had never fainted in her life, although she spent most of fourth grade practicing, in the hope that she could be one of those lucky girls who fainted during church and had to be carried out, draped across the muscly arms of their PE teacher, Mr. Gillespie.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that I&#x2019;m pregnant,&#x201d; she said. Let her see who she was calling a silly sausage.<br>Jane&#x2019;s mouth dropped. &#x201c;Jesus, Alice, you are not!&#x201d;<br>Spin Crazy Girl pursed her mouth as if she&#x2019;d caught Alice out being naughty. &#x201c;Oh dear, sweetie, I did ask at the beginning of the class if anyone was pregnant. I would have put you up front near the fan. You shouldn&#x2019;t have been so shy.&#x201d;<br>Alice&#x2019;s head thumped. Nothing anybody said was making sense.<br>&#x201c;Pregnant,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;At this time. What a disaster.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It is not!&#x201d; Alice put a protective hand to her stomach, so the Sultana wouldn&#x2019;t hear and be offended. Their financial situation was none of Jane&#x2019;s business. People were meant to be delighted when you announced a pregnancy.<br>&#x201c;I mean, what are you going to do?&#x201d; asked Jane.<br>For heaven&#x2019;s sake! &#x201c;Do? What do you mean, what am I going to do? I&#x2019;m going to have a baby.&#x201d; She sniffed. &#x201c;You smell of lavender. I knew I could smell lavender.&#x201d; Her sense of smell had been extra strong because of the pregnancy.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my deodorant.&#x201d; Jane really didn&#x2019;t look like herself. Her eyes didn&#x2019;t look right. It was quite noticeable. Maybe she needed to start using some sort of eye cream.<br>&#x201c;Are you all right, Jane?&#x201d;<br>Jane snorted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Worry about yourself, woman. You&#x2019;re the pregnant one knocking yourself out.&#x201d;<br>The baby! She&#x2019;d been selfishly thinking about her sore head when she should have been worrying about the poor little Sultana. What sort of a mother was she going to be?<br>She said, &#x201c;I hope I didn&#x2019;t hurt the baby when I fell.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, babies are pretty tough, I wouldn&#x2019;t worry about that.&#x201d;<br>It was another woman&#x2019;s voice. For the first time Alice looked up and realized a crowd of red-faced, middle-aged women in sports gear surrounded her. Some of them were leaning forward, staring at her with avid road-accident interest, while others had their hands on their hips and were chatting to one another as if they were at a party. They seemed to be in a small, fluorescentlit room. She could hear tinny music somewhere in the distance, clanking metal sounds, and a sudden burst of loud masculine laughter. As she lifted her head, she saw that the room was filled with stationary bikes, all crammed together and facing the same direction.<br>&#x201c;Although, you shouldn&#x2019;t really be doing exercise that gets your heart rate up too high if you&#x2019;re pregnant,&#x201d; said another woman.<br>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t do any exercise,&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;I should do more exercise.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You, my girl, couldn&#x2019;t do any more exercise if you tried,&#x201d; said Jane.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d; She looked around at the strange faces surrounding her. This was all so . . . silly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where I am.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s probably got a concussion,&#x201d; said somebody excitedly. &#x201c;Concussed people are dazed and disoriented.&#x201d;<br>Spin Crazy Girl looked frightened and stroked Alice&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Oh dear, sweetie, YOU MIGHT BE JUST A LITTLE BIT CONCUSSED,&#x201d; she yelled.<br>&#x201c;Ye...</p></p><h2>Pathfinders: The Golden Age Of Arabic Science</h2><p>In Pathfinders: The Golden Age of Arabic Science, Jim al-Khalili celebrates the forgotten pioneers who helped shape our understanding of the world.

Ruppelt (1923&#x2013;1960) was a United States Air Force officer probably best-known for his involvement in Project Blue Book, a formal governmental study of unidentified flying objects. He is generally credited with coining the term "unidentified flying object", to replace the terms "flying saucer" and "flying disk", which had become widely known; Ruppelt thought the latter terms were both suggestive and inadequate. Ruppelt was the director of Project Grudge from late 1951 until it became Project Blue Book in March 1952; he remained with Blue Book until late 1953. UFO researcher Jerome Clark writes, "Most observers of Blue Book agree that the Ruppelt years comprised the project's golden age, when investigations were most capably directed and conducted. Ruppelt himself was open-minded about UFOs, and his investigators were not known, as Grudge's were, for force-fitting explanations on cases."</p><h2>Bicycle Repair Step by Step: The Full-Color Manual of Bicycle Maintenance and Repair (Bicycle Books)</h2><p>Discusses the parts of the bicycle, tools, and repair techniques, and provides instructions for repairing each of a bicycle&#39;s major systems.</p><p></p><h2>Architecture and Design Library: Retro-Modern (Arch &amp; Design Library)</h2><p>With roots in prewar Germany, modernism leapt to popularity in postwar America. Advocated by architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius (who fled the encroaching Nazi movement and settled in the U.S.), modernism blended functionality with frugality. Between 1945 and 1960, architects like Frank Lloyd Wright and designers like George Nelson revolutionized the home landscape. Today, modernism is experiencing a resurgence in popularity. Filled with incredible photographs of classic modern homes and beautifully spare rooms, Retro Modern is well researched and admirably demonstrates the intersection of history, society, and the arts. The clean, cool lines of modern architecture was a direct rebuttal to the neoclassical styles that came before. Rooms flowed into one another and often included floor-to-ceiling glass walls to open the house to the natural world. &#34;The new structures placed emphasis on efficiency and function, as well as informality and comfort,&#34; says author Lisa Skolnik. Inside, bold, spare furnishings like low-slung sofas and ovoid glass coffee tables were arranged with minimum clutter and often featured built-in furniture to keep the space open and airy. Clocks, lamps, and glassware took on asymmetrical and free-form shapes; most popularly, kidneys, amoebas, and boomerangs.

What is the possibility of religion, specifically Christianity, thriving in our postmodern era? In this provocative new book, Gianni Vattimo, leading Italian philosopher, politician, and framer of the European constitution, addresses these critical questions. <br><br>When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium&#x2015;an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion&#x2015;and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.</p><p>What has been the fate of Christianity since Nietzsche&#39;s famous announcement of the &#34;death of God&#34;?

It presents you with an opportunity to gain a whole new outlook on how your personal health is affected by your private choices. It gives you practical tips on how to revitalize your life in ways that can lead to greater health, happiness, and success. Health and disease are different degrees of the same thing. Both originate from the same thing - physiological responses to stimuli. With predominately appropriate stimuli, you rest comfortably on the health side of the continuum. When most of the stimuli that spark physiological responses are inappropriate, you develop what we call &#34;disease.&#34; By understanding that health and disease are effects of perfect internal responses, you will never again look at your physical condition as the luck of the draw.</p><p>"As medical director working with Dr. Morter in a multi-discipline healthcare clinic, I never cease to be amazed in the relief of pain and the regaining of health - demonstrated daily by the patients I see coming in and out of the clinic!"

Speech and language pathologist Santa Rosa, California</p><p> "This book teaches practical steps for achieving mental and emotional balance, which is the very foundation of health. It's based on sound thinking refined through years of clinical experience. I highly recommend it." Dean Black, Ph.D. Author of Health at theCrossroads Mesa, Arizona</p>Health - or disease - is an effect, the offspring of our conscious choices in six essential areas of life: what we eat, what we drink, how we rest, how we exercise, what we breathe, and the granddaddy of them all - what we think. As a practical matter, none of us is in control of our circumstances or environment. However, each of us, as conscious, thinking, rational adults, is in control of our interpretation of our life events. By interpreting each incident - favorable or unfavorable - as an experience through which we learn, we provide health-enhancing stimuli for our perfect-responding bodies.<p> In our journey through health and life, we sometimes become "stuck" in ruts of psychic mud, such as fear, guilt, hopelessness, frustration, anxiety, and anger, that lead to disease. As Dr. M. Ted Morter Jr., explains, disease is an effect of physiological responses to these and other negative emotions when we fail to learn the lessons presented to us. Flourishing health, on the other hand, is the physiological effect of positive thoughts and attitudes, which in turn allow for synchronization and union with the Universal Intelligence.</p><p> DYNAMIC HEALTH is the result of three decades of study and clinical experience - experience that has reinforced Dr. Morter's conviction of the validity of the body-mind-energy connection that has skirted the fringes of healing for years, and that not only makes self-directed health possible but achievable. Dr. Morter presents concepts and recommendations that have proven effective in helping real people to handle stress better, to feel healthier and better about themselves, to feel more alive and energetic, and enjoy life more - a journey to whole health - dynamic health.</p></p><h2>Very Little Child&#39;s Book of Stories</h2><p>A collection of stories, rhymes, and folk tales arranged under the themes of &#34;The Little Child Out of Doors,&#34; &#34;In the Nursery with Mother Goose,&#34; and &#34;Grandmother&#39;s Fireside Tales&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Paths of Glory: The French Army, 1914-18 (CASSELL MILITARY PAPERBACKS)</h2><p>Anthony Clayton is an acknowledged expert on the French military and his book is a major contribution to the study and understanding of the First World War.

In this unforgettable literary debut, she writes about some of the most emotionally challenging and rewarding cases of her career.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Like many physicians, Fincham-Gray tends to see her patients at often life-or-death moments. While dramatic, these stories expand into deeper explorations of our complex, profound relationships with the animals in our lives. She describes the satisfaction of diagnosing and treating difficult diseases and the universal experience of loving a pet, and&#x2014;inevitably&#x2014;raises questions about their end-of-life care. We meet Grayling, an Irish wolfhound in need of critical treatment; we learn about the fulfillment of caring for a chronically ill pet from the story of Zeke, a silver-brown tabby cat who likes to eat just a little too much; and we fall in love with Monty and Emma, Fincham-Gray&#x2019;s own adopted cat and dog, who change her life in joyful and unexpected ways. Fincham-Gray depicts the sleepless nights she spends waiting for her pager to call her to the clinic, the cutthroat competition among residents, and what it&#x2019;s really like to care for patients who can&#x2019;t advocate for themselves.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Warm and humorous, Suzy Fincham-Gray is a rare breed&#x2014;a clinician with an intimate, elegant literary style.

Sunlight flitted through branches, splashing the wind- screen with unpredictable brilliance. The clean, savory perfume of the cow parsley clustered in the passing hedgerow mingled with the less subtle notes of manure clinging to my clothes. Beneath my stocking feet lay my lunch, along with empty syringe casings, odd scraps of paper with medical notes, and less identifiable detritus from our day&#x2019;s farm calls in the Herefordshire countryside. And beside me, expertly guiding the SUV around the twists and turns of the narrow lane, sat Peter, the large-animal veterinarian with whom I was &#x201c;seeing practice&#x201d;&#x2014;the UK term for gaining experience as a veterinary student by shadowing veterinarians in various settings.<br> We slowed, and Peter maneuvered the Land Rover into a gateway with a narrow dirt turnout that led to a long paddock running next to the road. There was one small gray pony in the field. We got out and walked to the back of the SUV, where I removed a pair of khaki Wellington boots and bottle-green coveralls from the boot. Peter was al- ready suited up and pulling on his wellies with practiced ease by the time I&#x2019;d unfolded my outfit. I stuffed the too-long pant legs into my socks before stepping into my wellies, holding on to the car for balance.<br><br> Shuffling around in the boot, he located a black case the size of a laptop beneath the piles of syringes, rectal examination gloves, medication bottles, and shiny stainless steel implements that made me want to cross my legs. Peter opened the case to reveal what looked like an old-fashioned pistol. Made from blackened metal, it was small and sturdy with a brown wooden handle. The grip had the patina of age, cured by the skin oils embedded in its crosshatch. It was the sort of thing I imagined from back in the Wild West, thousands of miles from this English field. Alongside the gun was a box of ammunition that served one specific purpose. This was a single-shot pistol, and I was about to shoot my first horse.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>I </b>had been volunteering at the small-animal clinic in the veterinary practice that Peter co-owned since I was fourteen, when my determination to become a vet had driven me to make weekly visits to observe Peter&#x2019;s small-animal partner, George, conducting his evening surgery.<br> The practice was a ten-minute walk from my childhood home in Hereford, a small cathedral city nestled on the Welsh border. In autumn, the short trek to the clinic was scented by delicious, yeasty apples fermenting at the cider factory across the street. During the spring, I was accompanied by the woolly odor and noise from trucks full of sheep and cattle on their way to market.<br><br> I&#x2019;d logged hours upon hours in the small-animal clinic, watching vaccination after vaccination, cleaning hundreds of cages and walking every conceivable size of dog.<br><br> George was a Scotsman with a booming brogue and generous stature, both of which were barely contained by the thin walls of the consulting room. The clinic was in a converted Edwardian house, and the waiting area, which had presumably once been the drawing room, was always filled with eager owners and nervous pets awaiting their turn with the &#x201c;Scottish vet.&#x201d; After each appointment, George would stand in the doorway, his shoulders filling the frame, and call out for his next client in the high-pitched, slightly girlish tone he used to talk to his patients. Every consultation started the same way: &#x201c;Hello, Mrs. Jones. How are you and Fluffy doing this lovely evening?&#x201d; And he would narrate the entire visit: &#x201c;Just a wee poke,&#x201d; when administering a vaccine; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be in and out in a flash,&#x201d; when de- scribing a surgery. Medications were prescribed by color and shape rather than their pharmacology. His parting words to every owner were &#x201c;Take them home and love them.&#x201d;<br><br> Over the years I&#x2019;d heard all of George&#x2019;s jokes and grown impatient at the unscientific language he used with his clients&#x2014;I aspired to learn the precise name and clinical description of every disease&#x2014;but I&#x2019;d bided my time in anticipation of the moment Peter would invite me into the passenger seat of his Land Rover. And, finally, after four years of formal veterinary education, I had graduated from my unobtrusive corner of the exam room to the passenger seat, ready to visit horses, cows, sheep, and any other beast too big or messy to fit into a consulting room. Now it was my turn to entertain high school volunteers in the kennel room with tales of calving successes, hoof trimming, and cesarean sections&#x2014;the same stories I had once listened to with rapt, jealous attention.<br><br> Although my upbringing was essentially urban&#x2014;if a city with a one-screen cinema, a handful of shops, a nightclub called Marilyn&#x2019;s, and a Pizza Hut was considered urban&#x2014;the countryside Peter and I traveled through was familiar. It was where my family took walks through bluebell-carpeted woods in spring, picked strawberries in summer, and stomped through piles of crunchy autumn leaves. The gamboling lambs, grazing cattle, and hard, stiff earth of a plowed winter field had once been little more than fun distractions. But riding with Peter on large-animal calls, visiting farms for TB testing, calving, and managing herd healthcare, I had come to realize how integral farming was to my home.<br><br> Peter was well known in Herefordshire&#x2014;with his muttonchops, and his cravat and collared shirt regardless of the day&#x2019;s duties. He was no match for George in physical stature, but he occupied an equally substantial place in the practice and community. Peter&#x2019;s energy was suited to the outdoors; his wiry forearms and strong grip were made for wrangling horses&#x2019; hooves, not tending to soft kittens&#x2019; paws. He carried the vaguely aloof brusqueness and rounded vowels of a country gentleman, and I felt na�ve and weighed down by my need to prove myself in his presence. Over the prior two weeks of our working together we&#x2019;d developed a good, if slightly distant, rapport. Com- pared to George and his jovial bedside manner, Peter had a more formal approach. But the rigor with which we discussed timely topics in veterinary medicine, and our meticulous daily reviews of clinical practice, more than made up for the lack of amiable banter.<br><br> We were visiting a pony who was no longer eating. Peter, who&#x2019;d examined her before, suspected lymphosarcoma, a cancer of white blood cells. Her owners had declined further diagnostics and treatment&#x2014;and to be present for this final visit. I didn&#x2019;t remember the pony&#x2019;s name. Peter had told me a few miles back, but it had instantly skidded from my mind. My thoughts were desperately clinging to the scientific and clinical aspects of the visit. I wanted to know her name, though, to gently whisper it under my breath once I stood in front of her. But more than that, I wanted to appear calm and com- posed. I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to ask.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>M</b>y childhood was littered with mostly imaginary animals. Despite my best attempts to convince my parents that a dog was an essential family member, I had to make do with stuffed toys and wheeled suitcases as companions. On one summer family vacation in a remote, soggy corner of Wales, I even adopted a pet rock, complete with a collar and leash fashioned from long-abandoned red twine. Unfortunately my parents did not share my enthusiasm for my new pet, and I was forced to abandon her at the end of the trip, leaving only my dad&#x2019;s endless apocryphal stories of his childhood puppy, Patch, to satisfy my dog-owning ambition.<br><br> Patch had been a black-and-white Border collie with a penchant for getting into trouble, and tales of him chewing through electrical cords, jumping out of a moving car&#x2019;s window, and dining on the con- tents of the compost heap were part of our family lore. Patch had died of old age when my dad was a teenager, but even decades later, it often seemed like he was about to trot into the room.<br> My dad was a dog person and, for as long as I could remember, I had wanted to be like him, right down to wishing that his exuberant caterpillar eyebrows would one day meet in the middle of my fore- head. While my mum&#x2019;s teaching career held no mystery&#x2014;I went to school every day; I knew what teachers did&#x2014;my dad was a microbiologist in a veterinary laboratory. And, because he wasn&#x2019;t occupied with keeping two girls fed, clothed, and clean along with holding down a full-time job, he was the parent who taught me how to ride a bike, tell a joke, look down a microscope, and what the offside rule in football meant. He was also an eager amateur photographer, and for a time our attic contained not only the precisely-to-scale model rail- way he spent hours researching, painting, and setting up, but also the red-lit mystery of a darkroom. Once I was old enough to be trusted around the shallow trays of alchemical liquids, I would hover close to my dad in the small space, enthralled, while pictures developed on previously stark sheets of photographic paper.<br><br> Ultimately, it was a simple picture that my dad took of a laboratory sink, discolored with the residue of dyes he&#x2019;d used to stain microscopic specimens, that illuminated my gateway into the world of science. I remember the first exhilarating instant I saw the image, the flat grayness of the once-white sink, the swirling blues, purples, and pinks curling around the drain in confusing whorls. I was fascinated, hooked. It was a visual representation of the days my dad spent culturing microscopic organisms on agar plates and in flasks of nutrient broth&#x2014;the type of scientific life I wanted to be a part of. <br><br> When I was fourteen, my interest crystallized into a determination to join the world of veterinary medicine. The mystery of abdominal cavities revealed by a scalpel and the secrets of bones discovered on X-rays were calling to me. I was entranced by the science of physiology and disease&#x2014;how bodies work, get broken, and are fixed again. I wasn&#x2019;t inspired by a family pet saved from the brink of death by a &nbsp;plucky veterinarian&#x2014;my rock was indubitably resilient&#x2014; and I couldn&#x2019;t tell heartening stories of baby birds I&#x2019;d nursed back to life from certain doom. My motivation came down to a picture of a dirty sink and a wonder at what lay beyond the plug hole.<br><br> Despite my uncommon inspiration, my dream of becoming a veterinarian was not unusual. The bucolic, very English portrayal of veterinary medicine in <i>All Creatures Great and Small, </i>a 1980s BBC series based on James Herriot&#x2019;s books, inspired millions every Sunday evening to consider the same path. The show was set during the 1940s and &#x2019;50s in a fictional North Yorkshire village. The countryside was rolling and unspoiled, and the heroes&#x2014;James and the younger Tristan Farnon&#x2014;dashing and brave. It was a halcyon place of small, neat stone cottages with meticulously planted gardens, and a pub where the gents drank pints of local ale while the ladies sipped tea at the vicarage.<br><br> Herriot&#x2019;s veterinarian was the center of a thriving agricultural community, driving from farm to farm delivering calves, treating lame horses, and performing the occasional house call for a rich landowner&#x2019;s over-pampered Pekingese. Women were wives and assistants, and veterinary medicine, in Herriot&#x2019;s time, was a male- dominated, large-animal-focused profession. It was, after all, only a few decades earlier, in 1922, that Aleen Cust, the first British female veterinarian, was finally permitted to practice, twenty-five years after she&#x2019;d completed her studies.<br><br> The tide, however, was turning. And by the mid-1990s, when I began veterinary school, two-thirds of my classmates were female. Despite this shift, the majority of the veterinarians I met seeing practice, and the senior lecturers and clinicians at university, were male. When I went on farm calls with Peter, my presence and my introduction as a vet student were sometimes met with skepticism and out- right sexism. Peter and George showed no such prejudice, but I desperately wanted to avoid giving anyone proof that I couldn&#x2019;t do a man&#x2019;s job, especially when it came to holding a gun against a horse&#x2019;s head and pulling the trigger.<br><br> When I started seeing practice with Peter&#x2014;the summer before the final year of my veterinary education&#x2014;I had not yet killed an animal. Although I&#x2019;d stood a respectful distance from the cats and dogs I&#x2019;d seen euthanized, passively witnessing their last breath, I had chosen not to look too closely at this aspect of my future career. I knew it was something I would do&#x2014;would have to do&#x2014;and I&#x2019;d heard veterinarians talk about how it was <i>the best decision </i>for a suffering pet. But I&#x2019;d never pictured myself administering the fatal bullet to a sick horse. I was so caught up in studying the factual, scientific nature of disease that I&#x2019;d barely had time to consider the practical applications for my patients.<br><br> Four years of vet school separated the teenager who&#x2019;d hovered in the corner of the examination room from the student who stood in that field. When I moved to London for my first year at university I&#x2019;d just turned nineteen. I was staying in Commonwealth Hall, a large intercollegiate residence. My dad had driven me the three hours east from Hereford to London. As the view through the car window changed from the countryside of my childhood to the monotonous gray of the motorway, my excitement shifted into a tugging dread that made me want to beg him to turn the car around. Instead, I complained about his taste in music and argued with him about which cassette to put in the player.<br><br> After we&#x2019;d decanted the contents of the boot and backseat into my cupboard of a room, I realized that the clod that had been slowly thickening in my throat all afternoon was going to make it difficult to say goodbye. A swift survey of my home for the next year had done little to raise my spirits&#x2014;a single bed with institutional sheets and a thin, lumpy duvet; a radiator covered in multiple layers of peeling paint; a small wardrobe that smelled of other people&#x2019;s clothes; a faux wood desk with the edges chipped and cracked; and, wedged in the corner, a tiny sink I preferred to think had been used only for washing hands and faces. My dad stood awkwardly in the only square foot of floor not occupied by suitcases or boxes.<br><br> &#x201c;All right, you&#x2019;ve got everything?&#x201d; he said.<br><br> &#x201c;I think so,&#x201d; I replied, unable to look him in the eye. I knew his black caterpillar eyebrows were drawn into a continuous questioning line.<br><br> &#x201c;I suppose I&#x2019;ll be off, then, before the traffic gets too bad.&#x201d; &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I paused. &#x201c;Shall I come to the car with you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, no need, you get settled here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; My small relief that I wouldn&#x2019;t have to walk back from the car alone with a press of tears behind my eyelids was soon tempered by the realization that this was goodbye.<br><br> &#x201c;Give us a call and let us know how you&#x2019;re doing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Will do.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Love you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Love you, too,&#x201d; I said. And then he was gone.<br><br> Sitting on my barely-twin bed, I listened to the excited bustle and chatter of other students moving in, making friends.

But when his estranged daughter Sarah comes to him with a request he cannot refuse, Moe takes a deep breath and plunges back into the icy, opaque waters of secrets and lies. Sashi Bluntstone, an eleven-year-old art prodigy and daughter of Sarah&#x2019;s dearest childhood friend, has been abducted. Three weeks into the investigation, the cops have gotten nowhere and the parents have gotten desperate. Desperation, the door through which Moe Prager always enters, swings wide open. Just as in Sashi&#x2019;s paintings, there&#x2019;s much more to the case than one can see at a glance.</p><p>With the help of an ex-football star, Moe stumbles around the fringes of the New York art scene, trying to get a handle on where the art stops and the commerce begins. Much to Moe&#x2019;s surprise and disgust, he discovers that Sashi is, on the one hand, revered as a cash cow and, on the other, reviled as a fraud and a joke. Suspects abound beyond the usual predators and pedophiles, for it is those closest to Sashi in life who have the most to gain from her death. Cruel ironies lurk around every corner, beneath every painting, and behind every door. Almost nothing is what it seems.</p><p>Beware the innocent monster, for it need not hide itself and it lives closely among us: sometimes as close as the mirror.</p><p>Reed Farrel Coleman's mysteries starring Moe Prager have won or been nominated for many of the crime fiction world's biggest awards, including the Edgar, the Shamus, the Barry, and the Anthony.

His writing has won nearly every major award in crime fiction.*Starred Review* Sashi Bluntstone, the 11-year-old Next New Thing on the New York art scene, has been abducted, and Moe Prager&#x2014;former NYPD cop and former PI&#x2014;is asked by his estranged daughter, Sarah, to join the search. He expects only tragedy; Sashi has already been missing for three weeks, and Moe hasn&#x2019;t been a PI for seven years. Now a well-to-do wine merchant, Moe agrees, primarily to attempt to restore his relationship with Sarah. He quickly learns that nothing increases the value of paintings faster than the death of the painter. Suspects abound: wealthy, self-important collectors; greedy gallery owners; odious rival artists; even the victim&#x2019;s parents. But Moe abides. This sixth Moe Prager novel is pretty much note-perfect. Coleman&#x2019;s take on the art world as a den of iniquity is priceless, as is Moe himself&#x2014;intelligent, street smart, and tough, especially for a sixtysomething. He&#x2019;s also sophisticated, despite seeing himself as a &#x201c;poor schmuck from Brooklyn.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s a mensch, and his bone-deep world weariness and mordant sense of humor should enthrall lovers of old-school, tough-talking, loner private eyes (think Loren D. Estleman&#x2019;s Amos Walker). --Thomas Gaughan</p><h2>Gallipoli</h2><p><p>A century has now gone by, yet the Gallipoli campaign of 1915-16 is still infamous as arguably the most ill conceived, badly led and pointless campaign of the entire First World War. The brainchild of Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, following Turkey's entry into the war on the German side, its ultimate objective was to capture the Gallipoli peninsula in western Turkey, thus allowing the Allies to take control of the eastern Mediterranean and increase pressure on�the Central Powers to drain manpower from the vital Western Front.�</p><p>�</p><p>From the very beginning of the first landings,�however, the campaign went awry, and countless casualties. The Allied commanders were ignorant of the terrain, and seriously underestimated the Turkish army which had been bolstered by their German allies. Thus the Allies found their campaign staled from the off and their troops hopelessly entrenched on the hillsides for long agonising months, through the burning summer and bitter winter, in appalling, dysentery-ridden conditions. By January 1916, the death toll stood at 21,000 British troops, 11,000 Australian and New Zealand, and 87,000 Turkish and the decision was made to withdraw, which in itself, ironically, was deemed to be a success.�</p><p>�</p><p>First published in 1956, when it won the inaugural Duff Cooper Prize, Alan Moorehead's book is still regarded as the definitive work on this tragic episode of the Great War. One could argue he was the first writer to capture the true turmoil that�occurred in this campaign with his colourful, analytical and compelling style of prose. Sir Max Hastings himself says in this new introduction that he was�inspired as a young man by Moorehead's books to become a reporter himself. With�in-depth analysis of the campaign, the objectives both sides set themselves,�and with character sketches of the main players, it brings the complex operation to life, showing how and why it went so terribly wrong and a century on, remains a by word for the loss of human life.</p></p><p>9 1.5-hour cassettesThe Allied campaign against Gallipoli began in 1915 when the Turks went into World War I on Germany's side. Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty in the British War Cabinet, conceived the plan of smashing through the Dardanelles with a fleet of old battleships and reopening the straits to Russian shipping.<p>For years the Turks had been beaten in every battle they fought, and the project stood a reasonable chance of success.</p><p>But what happened in the next nine months was a nightmare of lost opportunities, confused planning, and military incompetence.</p><p>Here is an epic of gallantry and folly -- the whole story of the most controversial campaign of modern times.</p></p><h2>Ovids Metamorphosis (Dunquin Series)</h2><p>Western mythology comes alive in this bold narration.</p><p><p>The classic Elizabethan translation of the Roman masterpiece, now in a new edition</p><p>Roland Boer is Associate Professor in Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies at Monash University, Australia.</p></p><h2>The Whole Foods Market Cookbook: A Guide to Natural Foods with 350 Recipes</h2><p>Who else but Whole Foods Market could create a cookbook so fresh, so appealing, so full of valuable information, and so perfect for the way we are all cooking and eating today?

The uses of fruit are varied: for food, drink, paint pigment, decoration, and medicine. The cultivation of fruit encouraged the development of plant propagation methods, grafting, hybridization, and selective breeding to produce ever improved varieties. </p><p> In this book Blackburne-Maze challenges myths such as the story of <i>Johnny Appleseed</i> whose real name was John Chapman. The fable that he indiscriminately scattered seeds is admittedly the worst way to propagate fruit trees. In truth he established a chain of successful apple nurseries that stretched from Pennsylvania to Indiana. </p><p> <b>Fruit</b> is illustrated with 300 large, striking and superbly reproduced color illustrations from the Lindley Library of the Royal Horticultural Society. Created by the finest botanical artists, these graceful illustrations are notable for their historical value in chronicling the evolution of fruit and as masterpieces in their own right. Included are varieties of fruit now extinct or no longer in widespread cultivation. </p><p> The book is organized into the 4 major fruit groups and covers 61 varieties:</p><ul> <li></li> Pome (apples, pears, etc.) <li></li>Stone (plum, cherry, peach, etc.) <li></li>Berry (currant, blueberry, etc.) <li></li>Exotic (fig, citrus, olive, almond, etc.) </ul><p></p><p> A companion volume to the critically acclaimed and extremely popular, <i>Flora</i>, this book will appeal to gardeners, art lovers, and food connoisseurs. </p></p><p><p> <b>Peter Blackburne-Maze</b> is a leading expert in the history and cultivation of fruit. He is the author of many books and regularly contributes to <i>Garden News</i>, <i>The Kitchen Garden</i>, and <i>The Garden</i> (the Royal Horticultural Society's journal). </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> We can all list a range of different fruit -- apples, pears, plums, bananas and oranges immediately spring to mind, for example. From a botanical point of view, however, a fruit is defined as a 'more or less fleshy pod, capsule or some other body produced by a plant in which it forms and carries its seeds'. The flesh makes the fruit look attractive to eat, and this helps seed distribution. Indeed, many a good seedling fruit tree started its life as a core or stone thrown from a car window and onto a fertile road verge. The feature of sweetness isn't crucial to the definition of a fruit (tomatoes, cucumbers and marrows are all perfectly good fruit), but in the popular sense of the word a 'fruit' has to be sweet, and this is the definition we will use in this book. </p><p> <b>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</b> </p><p> All the fruits in cultivation today are selections, mutations, hybrids or descendants of genera and species that originally grew in the wild. Prehistoric fruity remains have been found all round the world, including seeds of wild strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, sloe, bird cherry and crab apple. The spread of wild fruits in the world's temperate regions was dependent on the movement of the ice caps: as the earth's temperature rose, growing conditions improved. And, in the warmer regions, natural seed dissemination and other methods of propagation further promoted the spread of wild fruits across the globe. </p><p> The presence or absence of naturally growing food has largely dictated the advance of human beings into previously unpopulated areas. It is only comparatively recently that settlers have brought their own food plants with them. This phenomenon has taken place throughout the ages, and nowadays there are very few people in the world reliant on naturally occurring foodstuffs. </p><p> More than five thousand years ago (perhaps even earlier), the climate was favourable for agriculture, so huge areas were cultivated. Most temperate fruits originated from Central Asia and what was then Asia Minor -- the Caucasus, Turkestan and the Black Sea region -- where vast areas of woodland with wild pears, crab apples and cherry plums still exist (indeed, some of the wild grapes in Central Asia are identical to today's cultivated varieties). Further afield, there are quinces in Azerbaijan, apricots in Armenia and Syria, along with cherry plums, bird cherries and medlars. </p><p> This abundance of natural food in what became known as the Fertile Crescent (reaching from Iran to south of the Caspian Sea, to Turkey, through Palestine and into Egypt) encouraged nomadic tribes to settle in the area. This often brought new blood into an already flourishing civilization, therefore improving it further. During this period, the peach (<i>Prunus persica</i>) came from China (not Persia), where it has now been cultivated for more than 4000 years. </p><p> The first fruit to be stored for any length of time was probably the plum. These would have been sun-dried and then packed away for future use. Apples, too, were stored. They could have been dried as well, but were also laid on straw and placed in dry and cool surroundings. </p><p> Certainly as far back as 500 BC, Ancient Greek and Roman writers were writing about fruit and wine. Already both cultures were raising fruit, as well as growing vines from cuttings, and even then it was known that this kind of vegetative propagation was necessary amongst fruit plants in order to produce progeny identical to that of the parent. About two thousand years ago, fruit had become a highly important crop throughout the Mediterranean area. Excavations have shown pottery, glass, even the walls of houses, decorated with fruits. Evidence of orchards, nurseries and fruit markets were plentiful around Pompeii and Herculaneum, for example. Before the devastating eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, the slopes of the volcano were home to thriving horticultural and viticultural industries. </p><p> It was also around this time that varietal names started to appear. Many European fruit-growing practices started during the times of Roman occupation -- the English, for example, had little knowledge of horticulture or agriculture until the Romans occupied the country. After the Romans left (in AD 410), English growers returned almost to the wild for seven hundred years, but then the Normans invaded and got the fruit trade on its feet again, a situation that was partly aided by the self-sufficient monasteries. </p><p> The big explosion, however, came with the spread of fruit cultivation from Europe to the rest of the world (and the United States in particular). Once North America, Australia and Australasia were discovered and colonized, things simply snowballed on a global scale. This fact is prominent in most of the early books on fruit growing -- the further back you go, the more familiar the fruit varieties and methods of cultivation seem to become. North America and Australasia once (literally) put on the map, soon became the founts of knowledge on the subject. </p><p> The original settlers carried with them a sort of skeleton agriculture (including horticulture), which would see them through the first all-important years of colonization. Once the trauma of setting up a community in a new and totally isolated land (often complete with unfriendly local inhabitants) had been overcome, more time could then be spent on 'research and development'. This involved searching for local species of familiar plants and either taming them with cultivation or using them to breed locally desirable characteristics into existing varieties. Here, one often comes across occasions where the pupil overtakes the tutor, and the modern North American apple industry is a prime example. Of all the varieties bred in the USA during the last hundred years or so, most are eaten all over the world and many are also grown there -- for example, 'Golden Delicious', 'McIntosh, 'Jonathan', 'Jonagold, 'Red Delicious' and many more. </p><p> <b>METHODS OF PROPAGATION</b> </p><p> Seeds are the most common and cheapest way to grow a large number of plants quickly. However, seed is only useful when it gives rise to plants that are virtually identical to the parent. Although this is quite easily achieved with flowers and vegetables, it simply isn't possible with tree and bush fruits, whose progeny, when grown from seeds, seldom bears any resemblance to the parent. Any of the ancestors of an individual modern hybrid variety are likely to appear in the seedlings and normally it is the oldest genes that are the most dominant. </p><p> With vegetative propagation, part of the plant you wish to propagate is detached and is encouraged to form roots and develop into another plant. Most bush fruits, for example, are propagated from stem cuttings, but unfortunately cuttings from tree fruits do not root readily. It was the Romans who found the answer. Tree fruits, then and now, are propagated most easily and successfully by budding or grafting. A rootstock (a ready-made root system) and a 'scion' (a piece of the tree you are propagating) are joined and bound together. In a short time they fuse, and buds on the scion start to grow, eventually forming the new tree. And, because this is formed from part of the original tree, it is absolutely identical to it. </p><p> Later on, this gave rise to a peculiar belief that an individual variety of fruit had a predetermined life expectancy. According to this theory, when a seed germinated and grew into a new variety, an imaginary internal clock started ticking and continued to do so in all the progeny raised from it. This ticking would continue through the generations --until, say, a hundred years had passed after the 'birth' of the variety, when all its living descendants dropped dead and the variety was extinct. Such a theory is completely false, although not quite as stupid as it might sound, because something similar does actually occur with the bamboo, which has such an 'alarm clock' that goes off when it flowers. All the offspring of any particular bamboo plant will flower at more or less the same time, then it</p></p><h2>House Divided (Rediscovered Classics)</h2><p>First published in 1947, this bestselling historical novel is cherished and remembered as one of the finest retellings of the Civil War saga&#x2014;America's own <i>War and Peace</i>.

Jenny will never speak to Liza again. But it seems that even from beyond the grave, Liza is begging her sister for help.... <br> They say it's a serial killer. Is it? Jenny can't afford to trust anyone. Now she's here, in Wisteria, anonymously registered at the Chase College theater camp where her sister died. The daughter of a famous theatrical family, Jenny distrusts actors, loathes acting. Yet here in the college's darkened theatre, Liza seems to be speaking to her. Suddenly Jenny is mouthing Liza's last lines, sharing Liza's last days, a drama starring Brian, the stage manager, who seems to follow her everywhere...dangerously attractive Mike...Paul, who was obsessed with Liza...motherly, suffocating assistant director Maggie...and Walker, the director, bristling with hostility and resentment against Liza and Jenny's famous father. Does he suspect Jenny's true identity? <br> How can anyone know the visions that may be driving Jenny straight into the killer's arms?</p><p>Elizabeth Chandler is a pseudonym for Mary Claire Helldorfer. She is the author of the Kissed by an Angel and Dark Secrets series. She lives in Baltimore, Maryland.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br><i>Jenny? Jenny, are you there? Please pick up the phone, Jen. I have to talk to you. Did you get my e-mail? I don't know what to do. I think I'd better leave Wisteria.<br><br>Jenny, where are you? You promised you'd visit me. Why haven't you come? I wish you'd pick up the phone.<br><br>Okay, listen, I have to get back to rehearsal. Call me. Call me soon as you can. </i><br><br>I retrieved my sister's message about eleven o'clock that night when I arrived home at our family's New York apartment. I called her immediately, if somewhat reluctantly. Liza was a year ahead of me, but in many ways I was the big sister, always getting her out of her messes -- and she got in quite a few. Thanks to her talent for melodrama, my sister could turn a small misunderstanding in a school cafeteria into tragic opera.<br><br>Though I figured this was one more overblown event, I stayed up till two A.M., dialing her cell phone repeatedly. Early the next morning I tried again to reach her. Growing uneasy, I decided to tell Mom about the phone message. Before I could, however, the Wisteria police called. Liza had been found murdered.<br><br>Eleven months later Sid drove me up and down the tiny streets of Wisteria, Maryland. "I don't like it. I don't like it at all," he said.<br><br>"I think it's a pretty town," I replied, pretending not to understand him. "They sure have enough flowers."<br><br>"You know what I'm saying, Jenny."<br><br>Sid was my father's valet and driver. Years of shuttling Dad back and forth between our apartment and the theater, driving Liza to dance and voice lessons and me to gymnastics, had made him part of the family.<br><br>"Your parents shouldn't have let you come here, that's what I'm saying."<br><br>"Chase College has a good summer program in high school drama," I pointed out.<br><br>"You hate drama."<br><br>"A person can change, Sid," I replied -- not that I had.<br><br>"You change? You're the steadiest, most normal person in your family."<br><br>I laughed. "Given my family, that's not saying much."<br><br>My father, Lee Montgomery, the third generation of an English theater family, does everything with a flair for the dramatic. He reads grocery lists and newspaper ads like Shakespearean verse. When he lifts a glass from our dishwasher to see if it's clean, he looks like Hamlet contemplating Yorick's skull. My mother, the former Tory Summers, a child and teen star who spent six miserable years in California, happily left that career and married the next one, meaning my father. But she is still an effusive theater type -- warm and expressive and not bound by things like facts or reason. In many ways Liza was like Mom, a butterfly person.<br><br>I have my mother's red hair and my father's physical agility, but I must have inherited some kind of mutated theater gene: I get terrible stage fright.<br><br>"I don't think it's safe here," Sid went on with his argument.<br><br>"The murder rate is probably one tenth of one percent of New York's," I observed. "Besides, Sid, Liza's killer has moved north. New Jersey was his last hit. I bet he's waiting for you right now at the Brooklyn Bridge."<br><br>Sid grunted. I was pretty sure I didn't fool him with my easy way of talking about Liza's murderer. For a while it had helped that her death was the work of a serial killer, for the whole idea was so unreal, the death so impersonal, I could keep the event at a distance -- for a while.<br><br>Sid pulled over at the corner of Shipwrights Street and Scarborough Road, as I had asked him to, a block from the college campus. Before embarking on this trip I had checked out a map of Maryland's Eastern Shore. Wisteria sat on a piece of land close to the Chesapeake Bay, bordered on one side by the Sycamore River and on the other two by large creeks, the Oyster and the Wist. I had plotted our approach to the colonial town, choosing a route that swung around the far end of Oyster Creek, so we wouldn't have to cross the bridge. Liza had been murdered beneath it.<br><br>Sid turned off the engine and looked at me through the rearview mirror. "I've driven you too many years not to get suspicious when you want to be left off somewhere other than where you say you're going."<br><br>I smiled at him and got out. Sid met me at the back of the long black sedan and pulled out my luggage. It was going to be a haul to Drama House.<br><br>"So why aren't I taking you to the door?"<br><br>"I told you. I'm traveling incognito."<br><br>He rolled his eyes. "Like <i>I'm</i> famous and they'll know who you are when they see me dropping you off. What's the real reason, Jenny?"<br><br>"I just told you -- I don't want to draw attention to myself."<br><br>In fact, my parents had agreed to let me attend under a different last name. My mother, after recovering from the shock that I wanted to do theater rather than gymnastics, had noted that the name change would reduce the pressure. My father thought that traveling incognito bore the fine touch of a Shakespearean romance.<br><br>They were less certain about my going to the town of Wisteria, to the same camp Liza had. But my father was doing a show in London, and I told them that, at seventeen, I was too old to hang out and do nothing at a hotel. Since I had never been to Wisteria, it would have fewer memories to haunt me than our New York apartment and the bedroom I had shared with Liza.<br><br>I put on my backpack and gave Sid a hug. "Have a great vacation! See you in August."<br><br>Tugging on the handle of my large, wheeled suitcase, I strode across the street in the direction of Chase campus, trying hard not to look at Sid as he got in the car and drove away. Saying goodbye to my parents at the airport had been difficult this time; leaving Sid wasn't a whole lot easier. I had learned that temporary goodbyes can turn out to be forever.<br><br>I dragged my suitcase over the bumpy brick sidewalk. Liza had been right about the humidity here. At the end of the block I fished an elastic band from my backpack and pulled my curly hair into a loose ponytail.<br><br>Straight ahead of me lay the main quadrangle of Chase College, redbrick buildings with steep slate roofs and multipaned windows. A brick wall with a lanterned gate bordered Chase Street. I passed through the gate and followed a tree-lined path to a second quad, which had been built behind the first. Its buildings were also colonial in style, though some appeared newer. I immediately recognized the Raymond M. Stoddard Performing Arts Building.<br><br>Liza had described it accurately as a theater that looked like an old town hall, with high, round-topped windows, a slate roof, and a tall clock tower rising from one corner. The length of the building ran along the quad, with the entrance to the theater at one end, facing a parking lot and college athletic fields.<br><br>f0 <br><br>I had arrived early for our four o'clock check-in at the dorms. Leaving my suitcase on the sidewalk, I climbed the steps to the theater. If Liza had been with me, she would have insisted that we go in. Something happened to Liza when she crossed the threshold of a theater?it was the place she felt most alive.<br><br>Last July was the first time my sister and I had ever been separated. After middle school she had attended the School for the Arts and I a Catholic high school, but we had still shared a bedroom, we had still shared the details of our lives. Then Liza surprised us all by choosing a summer theater camp in Maryland over a more prestigious program in the New York area, which would have been better suited to her talent and experience. She was that desperate to get away from home.<br><br>Once she got to Wisteria, however, she missed me. She e-mailed every day and begged me to come and meet her new friends, especially Michael. All she could talk about was Michael and how they were in love, and how this was love like no one else had ever known. I kept putting off my visit. I had lived so long in her shadow, I needed the time to be someone other than Liza Montgomery's sister. Then suddenly I was given all the time in the world.<br><br>For the last eleven months I had struggled to concentrate in school and gymnastics and worked hard to convince my parents that everything was fine, but my mind and heart were somewhere else. I became easily distracted. I kept losing things, which was ironic, for I was the one who had always found things for Liza.<br><br>Without Liza, life had become very quiet, and yet I knew no peace. I could not explain it to my parents -- to anyone -- but I felt as if Liza's spirit had remained in Wisteria, as if she were waiting for me to keep my promise to come.<br><br>I reached for the brass handle on the theater door and found the entrance unlocked. Feeling as if I were expected, I went in.<br><br>Copyright � 2001 by Mary Claire Helldorfer</p><h2>How to Babysit a Grandma (How To...relationships)</h2><p>A little girl provides instructions for properly babysitting one&#39;s grandmother, such as taking trips to the park and singing duets.</p><p>JEAN REAGAN was born in Alabama but spent most of her childhood in Japan.

Urbex (Beauty in Decay, 2)</h2><p>Overgrown industrial complexes, disused asylums, abandoned palaces and monasteries feature in this latest incendiary book from Carpet Bombing Culture. Beauty in Decay - The Art of Urban Exploration broke new ground in depicting the global phenomenon of Urban Exploration (Urbex) when it published in 2010. Author RomanyWG has again tirelessly tracked down dozens of new locations to amaze viewers of Beauty in Decay II, a further peek behind the Urbex curtain. Urban explorers find the beauty layers of history, multi-hued peeling paint, antique objects, ancient initials in the dust and the other physical manifestations of memory that abandoned, impermanent urban spaces manifest. For Beauty in Decay RomanyWG has gone behind the lens to give us a further peak behind the Urbex curtain. This time the HDR is paired down and the spectacle ramped up.</p><p>RomanyWG is a film editor and photographer who&#39;s first book Beauty in Decay broke new ground in the genre of Urban ExplorationThis is even better than the first book. Not only are the photographs superb but there&#39;s more information in this book and it makes for a fascinating read.

But Verlyn Klinkenborg&#x2014;with his deeply empathetic relation to the world around him&#x2014;has done just that, and done it brilliantly, in <i>Timothy</i>.<br><br>This is the story of a tortoise whose real life was observed by the eighteenth-century English curate Gilbert White, author of <i>The Natural History of Selborne. </i> For thirteen years, Timothy lived in White&#x2019;s garden&#x2014;making an occasional appearance in his journals. Now Klinkenborg gives the tortoise an unforgettable voice and powers of observation as keen as those of any bipedal naturalist. The happy result: Timothy regales us with an account of a gracefully paced (no unseemly hurry!) eight-day adventure outside the gate (&#x201c;How do I escape from that nimble-tongued, fleet-footed race? . . . Walk through the holes in their attention&#x201d;) and entertains us with shrewd observations about the curious habits and habitations of humanity. &#x201c;To humans,&#x201d; Timothy says with doleful understanding, &#x201c;in and out are matters of life and death. Not to me. Warm earth waits just beneath me. . . . The humans&#x2019; own heat keeps them from sensing it.&#x201d; <br><br>Wry and wise, unexpectedly moving, and enchanting at every&#x2014;careful&#x2014;turn, <i>Timothy </i>will surprise and delight readers of all ages.</p><p>Verlyn Klinkenborg<b> </b>is a member of the editorial board of <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>. His previous books include <i>Making Hay, The Last Fine Time,</i> and <i>The Rural Life</i>. He lives in upstate New York.I was gone for more than a week before they found me. A rustling in the bean-field, heavy steps nearby. A shout--the boy's voice--more shouts. Thomas catches me up in his hands with sickening haste. I weigh six pounds thirteen ounces. He lifts me as though I weigh nothing at all.<br><br> Ground breaks away. May wind shivers in my ears. My legs churn the sky on their own. I look down on bean-tops. Down on the blunt ends of sheep-bitten grasses. Over one field, into the next, into the hop-garden beyond. Past thatch and tiles, past maypole, past gilded cock on the church tower. All in my eye, all at once. So far to see.<br><br> Goody Hammond and Daniel Wheeler's boy totter forward beside Thomas. Great warm two-legged beasts. Stilt-gaited like the rest of their kind. The boy prances backward, eyeing me closely. Bland watery orbs, fringed with pale hair. Cavernous mouth. Halloos as though I were the king's stag being drawn through the village in a deer-cart.<br><br> My week gone in two-score of their strides. Through the meadow. Past the alcove and down the brick-walk. Wicket-gate clicks shut behind us. Thomas sets me down beside the asparagus. Edge of my umbrageous forest. All feet square on the ground again. Into the rubbery trunks. Young asparagus thrusting out of the earth like turtles' heads. Ferns just joining in a canopy above. Print of Thomas's warm fingers on my tiled belly, smell of tar and damp mould.<br><br> The voices separate and blow away. The boy's cries ring down the street with cries of other boys. A silence behind them, a hollow in the day. Earthworms breach and tunnel, tunnel and breach. Old Hercules in the Great Mead gestures as always, unmoving. Wooden features sadly weathered even since I first knew him. Goody Hammond sweeps white-apple blossoms from the grass-plot. Sings a scrap of song over and over as she works. Wheezing like the blacksmith's bellows across the way.<br><br> "O Christ! My very Heart doth bleed with Sorrow for thy Sake . . ."<br><br> Greenfinch rattles in the beds nearby, heedless of danger. Mayfly vanishes in the blur of a swallow's wings over the gravel walk. Swallow-bill closes, a smart snap, shutting of a watch-case.<br><br> The fuss the humans made when they found me. Escape of the Old Sussex Tortoise! Eight Days' Pursuit! Captured in Hampshire Bean-field! Authentic Deeds of Old Gardener, Weeding Woman, Shocking Boy!<br><br> Thomas regarded me sternly before setting me down. Cocked his hat. Took breath to speak, then didn't. Watched till I was deep in the asparagus, safely out of sight.<br><br> "Out!" Daniel Wheeler's boy shouted when they found me, stumbling over his heels. "Timothy got out!"<br><br> The boy is mistaken. There is no Out! Humans believe the asparagus forest is In! Fruit wall, laurel hedge. Melon-ground. They prey upon the distinction. But I am always Out. Among the anemones. On the grass-plot. In the shade of the Dutch-currant trees. In the sainfoin just short of the Pound Field. Under young beans a week away. Under the rasp and green-rust smell of their leaves.<br><br> And I was In there, too, as always. In, under unhedged stars, dark of the moon. Among chiding of field-crickets, stirring of long grasses, gleaming wind. Groaning of beech trees on the Hanger. Clap of thunder and din of hail. The honeyed smell of maples and sycamores in bloom. Clouds pulling apart to show their crimson. Beyond sight of humans. Within my beloved shell.<br><br> Great soft tottering beasts. They are out. Houses never by when they need them. Even the humblest villagers live in ill-fitting houses. The greater the personage the worse the fit. Crescent of pale shell at the ends of their fingers. Drab furrows of person-scented cloth hang about them. Dimity, corduroy, buckram, fustian, holland, shalloon, cambric, stuff, wool. False head of hair or kerchief or hat.<br><br> Contrivance of hide or wood on the feet, or none at all. Crust of polished dirt, sore-cracked soles, broken nails. Nothing as elegant as a horse's clean hoof, the arc of its wall. My own cruel claws. That mass of body and brainpan to heat and cool with their internal fires. No tegument, no pelt to help them. Only what they fashion for themselves. What they scab together from the world. Fleece, hide, feathers, scales, and shell all denied them. Faint, thin leather of their own growing, proof against nothing. Uneconomic creatures.<br><br> Humans of Selborne wake all winter. Above ground, eating and eating, breathing and shitting, talking and talking. Huddled close to their fires. Fanning the ashes. Guarding the spark. Never a lasting silence for them. Never more than a one-night rest. When they go down in the ground, they go down in boxes, for good, and only with the help of others standing round. Peering into the darkness of the cold earth they fear. The neat, rectangular hole.<br><br> Men haul peat from the forest, laboring over ruts and horse-tracks and onto the village cart-way. They measure out bushels of coal. Cut cord-wood. Stack beech-billet, cleft-wood, and faggots. Go to law over lop and top. Smoke beats down over the village. Tumbles from chimneys, thick over the fields. Beech-smoke, coal-smoke, peat-smoke. London smoke, a sulfurous haze from the northeast.<br><br> Cold wind settles against the glass. Rain under the tiles, through the wind-torn thatch. Only the oak-shingled roof of St. Mary's keeps tight above the village. Flights of snow. Epidemic freeze. Winter comes like the clamoring of the stone-curlew. A noise in the air of something passing quick over their heads after it becomes dark.<br><br> To humans, in and out are matters of life and death. Not to me. Warm earth waits just beneath me, the planet's viscous, scalding core. It takes a cool blood to feel that warmth, here at its circumference. The humans' own heat keeps them from sensing it. I drift for months--year's great night--floating on the outer edge of Earth's corona. The only calendar my blood, how it drugs me.<br><br> When autumn pinches, I dig. November darkens, fasting long since begun. Day after day. Steady, steady. Stroke on one side. Stroke on the other. Slow as the hour-hand and just as relentless. Swimming in place, burrowing my body's length and depth. Ease in, out, adjust the fit. Another day or two. No rush. No rush. Ease in again. A last fitting. Air hole open. Stow legs. Retreat under roof of self. Under vault of ribs and spine.<br><br> Loose earth covers my back. Laurel leaves, walnut leaves, chalk soil, Dorton mould. I wait, then cease to wait. Earth rolls repeatedly through day and night. Layer of rime. The frost binds. Then snow, that friendly meteor. Kindly mantle of infant vegetation. Insulating all of us who cling to the soil. Who have not got too upright, too far from the native horizontal. Earth beneath me throbs with warmth. Cold black sky presses down. Current of memory tugs at me. A long, long descent into perfect absence. I remember only where I'm going.<br> Meanwhile, the village stirs. Boys slide on ice. Girls chap hands. Straddle-bob Orion tips downward over the brew-house, over the Hanger. Barnyard turnip-piles freeze hard as stone. Men shovel the track to Newton. Hollow lanes--deep as a cottage, narrow as a walk--fill with snow. Pack-horses go belly-deep in open country.<br><br> Rugged Siberian weather. Laplandian-scene. The village cut off for weeks, hidden in the folds of England. Poultry confounded. Bantams fly over their house. Forty-one sheep buried in snow. Redbreasts, wrens, and beggars in barns and cow-houses. Worries about prices of mutton, hay, barley seed. Haws freeze on hedges. Pheasant stands on dung-pile. Hares cross the garden snowpack and crop the pinks. Gardeners take aim from the windows.<br><br> Mr. Gilbert White watches through the parlor window. Tries to remember just where he saw me digging last fall. All his garden buried in drifts. Returns to his letter. Stitch in his side from writing. To niece Molly in London, asking her to send breakfast green tea and best tea. Great beast of a town. Cold as Petersburg. Londoners on the frozen Thames. Snow like bay-salt. Carriages quiet on the cobbles for once, cushioned by snow. Sound of a deserted city. Many weeks until mackerels are cried in the streets. Until green geese move along them in droves, driven by a boy just their speed.<br><br> Mr. Gilbert White writes. Mad dog from Newton great farm bites dogs in the Selborne street. Farmer Berriman's cow, he reports, "got into the barn's floor in the night, and gorged herself so at an heap of thrashed wheat, that she dyed what they call sprung, being blown up to a vast size." Seventeen residents of Newton farm, and a horse, have gone in a cart to be dipped in the sea. Mrs. John White knits beside Mr. Gilbert White. One row for her old life, one for the new.<br><br> Parlor-cat turns electric in dry nights of frost. Parlor-fire rages. Close-stools freeze beneath beds. Horses breathe their stable-fog. Lambs drop from the womb and freeze to the ground. Venus shadows. Walls stream with water. Thatch reeks in the sun. Fields pour torrents into the lanes that worm their way toward Selborne. Waking dreams of the human winter.<br><br> My blood creeps along a dark endless track. On quiet feet. Circles round and round as though it had lost its way but always finding its way again. No counting the circuits it makes under the compass-rose of my carapace.<br><br> One day corpuscles prick as they pass. Agitation in the capillaries. New trails through the underwood of flesh. Fresh tide washes over the rocks. Rushing millstream spills through the heart. I rouse before I know I'm rousing. Hatched from the great egg of Earth. Spring-wrecked on the surface, my living to make. Pipped again.<br><br> I blink and blink. Look into my crater, the nest that bears me over and over...</p><h2>More: Do More of What Makes You Feel Alive &#x2014; A perfect way to offer inspiration to those graduating, retiring, making a fresh start, or beginning a new adventure.</h2><p>Big, meaningful, wholehearted living is so much more than just measuring up, moving on or getting by.

S. Merwin vividly conveys his intimate knowledge of the people and the countryside in this ancient part of France (home of the Lascaux caves). In three narratives of small-town life, Merwin shows with matchless poetic and narrative power how the past is still palpably present.<br>On its original publication in 1992 Jane Kramer wrote, "These stories are a gift from one of the great poets of the English language, a chronicle of the heartstopping seasons of one small corner of La France Profonde and of its stubborn and illusive characters. Merwin&#x2019;s French peasants are a force of nature, like the blackberry brambles that used to choke his garden, and he cultivates them both with that attentive, exacting, and relentlessly patient genius that great poets and great gardeners share. This is, simply, the most beautiful writing about France I know."<br></p><p><b>W. S. Merwin</b> is the author of many highly regarded books of poetry and prose, for which he has received the Pulitzer Prize, the Bollingen Award, and numerous other awards. He lives in Hawaii.<br>&#34;Poignant, ironic, often beautiful, with wonderful subtleties and textures--a true gift of fine prose from a fine poet, and a delightful book.&#34;</p><h2>Prince of Thieves: A Novel</h2><p>The branch manager of a Boston bank, Claire Keesey finds herself attracted to very different men--Doug MacRay, the leader of a tight-knit crew of criminals and bank robbers, and FBI agent Adam Frawley--but her relationships are complicated by Frawley&#39;s plans to eliminate Boston&#39;s criminal element and by Doug&#39;s gang&#39;s plans to rob Fenway Park.

His most recent novel, <i>Prince of Thieves,</i> was awarded the Hammett Prize for excellence in crime writing, and is being made into a major motion picture by Warner Brothers. He lives with his family in Massachusetts.<b>Chapter One: The Bank Job</b><br><br>Doug MacRay stood inside the rear door of the bank, breathing deeply through his mask. Yawning, that was a good sign. Getting oxygen. He was trying to get amped up. Breaking in overnight had left them with plenty of downtime to sit and eat their sandwiches and goof on each other and get comfortable, and that wasn't good for the job. Doug had lost his buzz -- the action, fear, and momentum that was the cocktail of banditry. Get in, get the money, get out. His father talking, but fuck it, on this subject the old crook was right. Doug was ready for this thing to fall.<br><br>He swung his head side to side but could not crack his neck. He looked at the black .38 in his hand, but gripping a loaded pistol had long since lost its porn. He wasn't there for thrills. He wasn't even there for money, though he wouldn't leave without it. He was there for the job. The job of the job, like the thing of the thing. Him and Jem and Dez and Gloansy pulling pranks together, same as when they were kids -- only now it was their livelihood. Heisting was what they did and who they were.<br><br>His blood warmed to that, the broad muscles of his back tingling. He rapped the hard plastic forehead of his goalie mask with his pistol barrel and shook out the cobwebs as he turned toward the door. A pro, an athlete at the top of his game. He was at the height of his powers.<br><br>Jem stood across from him like a mirror image: the dusty navy blue jumpsuit zipped over the armored vest, the gun in his gloved hand, and the white goalie mask marked up with black stitch scars, his eyes two dark sockets.<br><br>Happy voices approaching, muffled. Keys turning in reinforced locks, strongbars releasing.<br><br>A spear of daylight. A woman's hand on the knob and the kick of a chunky black shoe -- and the swish of a black floral skirt walking into Doug's life.<br><br>He seized the branch manager's arm and spun her around in front of him, showing her the pistol without jamming it in her face. Her eyes were green and bright and full, but it was his mask that scared short her scream, not the Colt.<br><br>Jem kicked the door shut behind the assistant manager, smacking the cardboard caddy out of the guy's hand. Two steaming cups of coffee splattered against the wall, leaving a runny brown stain.<br><br>Doug took the bank keys from the manager's hand and felt her going weak. He walked her down the short hallway to the tellers' row behind the front counter, where Gloansy -- identically dressed, masked, and Kevlar-bulked -- waited. The bank manager startled at the sight of him, but she had no breath left for screaming. Doug passed her off to Gloansy, who laid her and the gray-suited assistant manager face-first on the carpeting behind the cages. Gloansy started yanking off their shoes, his voice deepened and filtered by the mask.<br><br>Lie still. Shut your eyes. Nobody gets hurt.<br><br>Doug moved with Jem through the open security door into the lobby. Dez stood beside the front door, hidden from Kenmore Square by the drawn blinds. He checked the window before flashing a blue-gloved thumb, and Doug and Jem crossed the only portion of the lobby visible from the ATM vestibule.<br><br>Jem unfolded a deep canvas hockey bag on the floor. Doug turned the stubbiest key on the manager's ring in the night-deposit cabinet lock, and silver plastic deposit bags spilled to the floor like salmon from a cut net. A holiday weekend's worth. Doug gathered them up five and six at a time, soft bags of cash and checks bundled in deposit slips, dumping the catch into Jem's open duffel.<br><br>After raiding the night drop, Doug went on alone to the access door behind the ATM. He matched key to lock, then looked over to the tellers' cages where Jem had the branch manager on her feet. She looked small without shoes, head down, hair slipping over her face.<br><br>"Again," Jem commanded her. "Louder."<br><br>She said, staring at the floor, "Four. Five. Seven. Eight."<br><br>Doug ignored the choke in her voice and punched the code into the mechanical dial over the key. The door swung open on the ATM closet, and Doug unlatched the feeder and pulled the cash cassette. After the long weekend it was less than half full. He scooped out the sheets of postage stamps as an afterthought and dumped them with the tens and twenties into the bag. Then he flipped the service switch, reloaded the empty cassette, and hustled back past the check-writing counter, running the bag through the open security door to the tellers' cages.<br><br>There, he retrieved a small strongbox from a drawer at the head teller's station. Beneath some dummy forms and a leftover stack of flimsy giveaway 1996 desk calendars was a brown coin envelope containing the cylindrical vault key.<br><br>They could have been a couple waiting for an elevator, except for the gun: Jem and the manager standing together before the wide vault door. Jem was holding her close, exploring the curve of her ass through her skirt with the muzzle of his .45 as he whispered something in her ear. Doug made noise coming up behind them and Jem's gun moved to her hip.<br><br>Jem said, "She says the time lock's set for eight eighteen."<br><br>The digital clock built into the vault door said 8:17. They stood for that one minute in silence, Doug behind the manager, listening to her breathing, watching the hands of her self-hugging arms grip her sides.<br><br>The clock changed to 8:18. Doug inserted the key over the thick black dial.<br><br>"We know all about panic codes," Jem told the manager. "Now open it clean."<br><br>Her hand came out stiffly, steadying itself against the cool steel door and leaving a brief, steamy palm print there before starting in on the dial. When she hesitated after the second turn, Doug knew she had made a mistake.<br><br>"No fucking stalling," said Jem.<br><br>She dried her quivering hand on her skirt. The second time, she made it past the third number of the combination before her nerves betrayed her, her fingers twisting the dial too far.<br><br>"For Christ!" said Jem.<br><br>"I'm sorry!" she wailed, half in anger, half in terror.<br><br>Jem put the gun to her ear. "You have kids?"<br><br>She veered away from him, her voice strangled. "No."<br><br>"A husband? Boyfriend?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Christ! Parents, then. Do you have parents? Who the fuck can I threaten?"<br><br>Doug stepped in, easing Jem's gun away from her face. "How many attempts before the lock triggers a duress delay?"<br><br>She swallowed. "Three."<br><br>Doug said, "And how long until it can be opened again after that?"<br><br>"I think -- fifteen minutes."<br><br>"Write it down," said Jem. "Write out the combination, I will fucking do it myself."<br><br>Doug looked at her grimacing face in profile, feeling her fear. "You don't want us here another fifteen minutes."<br><br>She considered that a second, then reached fast for the dial, her hand darting like a bird from a cage. Doug caught her wrist, held it firm.<br><br>"Slow," he said. "Take your time. Once you start, do not stop."<br><br>She wrapped a fist around her thumb. When he released her, her hand went cautiously to the dial. Her fingers obeyed her this time, shaking again only as she approached the final number. The interior clack was audible.<br><br>Jem spun the locking wheel and the door released, opening on massive hinges, the vault emitting a cool, cottony yawn after a long weekend's sleep.<br><br>Doug grabbed the manager's arm and walked her away. She paused in sight of her office, their entry point, where they had brought the ceiling down on top of her desk.<br><br>"It's my birthday," she whispered.<br><br>Doug walked her fast out to Gloansy, who put her back with the assistant manager, facedown on the floor. Dez stood near with his scarred mask cocked at a quizzical angle. A radio check, him listening to the unseen wire rising up from inside his jumpsuit collar.<br><br>"Nothing," Dez said. The police frequencies were all clear.<br><br>As a conquest, vault interiors always disappointed Doug. The public access areas such as the safe-deposit rooms were kept polished and showroom clean, but the actual money rooms were no more impressive than utility closets.<br><br>This vault was no exception. The main cabinet door containing the cash reserves was made of thin metal and fastened with a flimsy desk lock, which Doug busted open in one stroke. Despite the vault's hard-target exterior, once you were in, you were in. He ignored the heavy racks of rolled coins and instead pulled down stacked bundles of circulated paper currency. The color-coded paper straps that banded the bills told him the denominations at a glance: red for $5s, yellow for $10s, violet for $20s, brown for $50s, and beautiful mustard for $100s. He snapped them off as he went, fanning the wads of cash, spot-checking for dye packs and tracers.<br><br>Four cash-on-wheels teller trucks lined the back of the vault. The top drawers held about $2,500 each, and Doug cleared out all of it except the bait bills, the thin, paper-clipped bundles of twenties laid out at the bottom of each slot. The first drawer was the one tellers drew from during routine transactions, the one they emptied in the event of a stickup.<br><br>The second drawers were deeper than the first, containing higher denominations for commercial transactions and account closings, more than four times as much money as the first drawers. Doug again emptied each one down to the bait bills.<br><br>They ignored the safe-deposit room altogether. Opening boxes would have meant drilling each door individually, ten minutes per lock, two locks per box. And even if they did have all day, the Kenmore Square BayBanks branch served a transient community of Boston University students and apartment renters, so there was no point. In an upscale-neighborhood bank, the safe boxes would have been the primary target, since branches in wealthier zip codes usually carry less operating cash, their customers relying on direct deposit rather than paycheck cashing, purchasing things with plastic rather than paper.<br><br>Dez's blue palm halted them on the way back. "Asshole at the ATM."<br><br>Through the blinds, Doug made out a college kid in sweats playing the machine for allowance money. His card was rejected twice before he bothered to read the service message on the screen. He looked to the door, checking the bank hours printed there, then lifted the customer service phone off the receiver.<br><br>"Nope," said Dez.<br><br>In the middle of this, Doug looked at the manager lying behind the second teller's cage. He knew things about her. Her name was Claire Keesey. She drove a plum-colored Saturn coupe with a useless rear spoiler and a happy-face bumper sticker that said Breathe! She lived alone, and when it was warm enough, she spent her lunch hours in the community gardens along the nearby Back Bay Fens. He knew these things because he had been following her, off and on, for weeks.<br><br>Now, up close, Doug could see the faintly darker roots of her hair, the pale brown she treated honey blond. Her long, black linen skirt outlined her legs to the lacy white feet of her stockings, where jagged stitching across the left heel betrayed a thrifty mending never meant to be seen.<br><br>She rolled her head along her bent arm, just enough for a peek up at Gloansy, who was hunched over and watching the kid on the ATM phone. Her left leg began to creep toward the teller's chair. Her foot slipped underneath the counter and out of Doug's sight, poking around under there, then gliding swiftly back into position, her eyes returning to the crook of her elbow.<br><br>Doug exhaled slowly. Now he had a problem.<br><br>The kid in the ATM gave up on the dead telephone and kicked the wall before shoving bitchily through the doors out into the early morning.<br><br>Jem dropped the loot bag next to the tool bag and the work bag. "Let's blow," he said, exactly what Doug wanted to hear. As Gloansy pulled plastic ties from his pockets, and Jem and Dez lifted jugs of Ultra Clorox from the work bag, Doug turned and walked fast down the rear hall into the employee break room. The security equipment sat on wooden shelves there, and the system had tripped, the cameras switched on and recording, a small red light pulsing over the door. Doug stopped all three VCRs and ejected the tapes, then unplugged the system for good measure.<br><br>He brought the tapes back out to the front and dumped them into the work bag without anyone else seeing. Gloansy had the assistant manager in one of the teller's chairs, binding the guy's wrists behind the chair back. Bloody snot painted the assistant manager's lips and chin. Jem must have flat-nosed him on their way in.<br><br>Doug lifted the heavy tool bag to his shoulder just as he saw Dez quit splashing bleach, setting his jugs down on the floor.<br><br>"Hold it!" Dez called out.<br><br>Dez's finger went to his ear as Jem emerged from the vault, jugs in hand. Gloansy stopped with the manager seated behind the assistant manager now, back-to-back, a tie for her wrists ready in his free hand. Everyone looked at Dez -- except Doug, who was looking at the manager staring at the floor.<br><br>Dez said, "Silent alarm call, this address."<br><br>Jem looked for Doug. "What the fuck?" he said, setting down his bleach.<br><br>"We're done here anyway," said Doug. "We're gone. Let's go."<br><br>Jem drew his pistol, keeping it low at his hip as he approached the seated bankers. "Who did it?"<br><br>The manager kept staring at the floor. The assistant manager stared at Jem, a black forelock of hair hanging ragged and sullen over his eyes.<br><br>"We were gone," said Jem, pointing at the back hallway with his gun. "We were out that fucking door."<br><br>rdThe assistant manager winced at Jem through his hair, eyes watering from the bleach fumes, still sore from his cuffing at the door.<br><br>Jem locked on him. Wounded defiance was the worst possible play the assistant manager could make.<br><br>Dez picked up his bleach, hurriedly finishing splashing it around. "Let's go," he said.<br><br>"We've gotta move," Doug told Jem.<br><br>Another few seconds of staring, and the spell was broken. Jem stepped off, relaxing his gun hand, slipping the piece back inside his belt. He was already turning away when the assistant manager said, "Look, no one did any -- "<br><br>Jem flew at the man in a blur. The sound of knuckles against temple was like a tray of ice being cracked, Jem holding back nothing.<br><br>The assistant manager whipped left and slumped over the armrest, the chair tipping and falling onto its side.<br><br>The assistant manager sagged, still bound to the chair by his wrists. Jem dropped to one knee and hammered away again and again at the defenseless guy's cheek and jaw. Then Jem stopped and went back for his bleach. Only Doug's hooking his arm stopped Jem from emptying the jug over the man's shattered face.<br><br>That close, Doug could see the pale, nearly white-blue of Jem's irises within the recesses of the goalie mask, glowing like snow at night. Doug twisted the bleach out of Jem's hand and told him to load the bags. To Doug's surprise, Jem did just that.<br><br>Doug soaked the night drop in the lobby. He soaked the carpet where they had filled the loot bag, jumpy near the windows, expecting sirens. He shook out the jug over the ATM cassette, then returned to the counter.<br><br>The assistant manager remained hanging off the overturned chair. Only his wheezing told Doug the guy was still alive.<br><br>The bags were gone. So was the manager.<br><br>Doug walked to the back, bleach fumes swamping his vision. The bags were stacked and waiting, and Dez and Jem both had their masks off, standing at the rear door, Jem's hand clamped on the back of the manager's neck, keeping her from seeing their faces. Dez picked up her brown leather handbag where it had...</p><h2>The Freak Factor: Discovering Uniqueness by Flaunting Weakness</h2><p>Unleash your<br>inner freak...<br>and discover your unique potential.<br><br>Think of the thing that makes you strange&#x2015;the weakness that you won&#x2019;t admit during a job<br>interview or performance evaluation.

The creation of the German Home Guard or Volkssturm on 18 October 1944 was a desperate measure by the Nazi regime to utilize every available manpower resource in their last-ditch attempts to delay their inevitable defeat. All able-bodied males between the ages of 16 and 60 who were not already members of the German Armed Forces were conscripted into one organization. The aim of the Volkssturm was to shore up the defense of the Reich, but also to restrict any possible revolt or dissent by exercising military discipline over the entire male population of fighting age. This Nazi fantasy was the creation of a new force of highly-motivated Aryans dedicated to the heroic defense of their fatherland. However, the Volkssturm failed due to poor equipment, lack of training, and low morale. Men who had no experience of combat and little or no inclination to fight, and who had little interest in the Nazi regime found themselves sent into battle against impossible odds and achieving little or nothing. </p><p>The focus of the book is the section of Germany's western front where the Volkssturm fought in vain to slow the advance of Canadian forces and where the desertion rate was very high. David K. Yelton follows the experience of a Volkssturm conscript from his call-to-arms, into action and through to his capture and time as a POW, examining his personal reaction to the creation of the German Home Guard and his response to the fighting into which he was thrust.</p></p><p>Dr David K. Yelton is Professor of History and Chair of the Social Sciences Department at Gardner-Webb University, North Carolina. His lifetime work as been the study of twentieth-century Germany and military, political and diplomatic history. He has written numerous academic monographs and articles on the Volkssturm and has conducted research trips to Western German archives for source material. He lives in North Carolina. The author lives in North Carolina, USA.&#x201c;There have been few books published in English specifically on the Volkssturm.

The potlatch, a festive gathering marked by the lavish distribution of gifts to guests as a sign of the host's status, is central in the tradition of the Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island and the mainland opposite. Ritualistic simulated cannibalism was a feature of some potlatches, which led to the Canadian government's outlawing of the ceremony in 1884. The Kwakiutl continued to potlatch furtively until the ban was rescinded in 1951. Dramatic masks, symbolic wall paintings, headdresses, feast dishes and blankets are among the objects reproduced, together with archival and contemporary photographs attesting to the persistence of the potlatch tradition. Essays by scholars discuss Kwakiutl ritual dance, analyze the social significance of potlatch and reveal how anthropologist Franz Boas, the museum's curator from 1895 to 1905, acquired a wealth of potlatch objects with the help of his chief informant, George Hunt, a half-English, half-Tlingit Native anthropologist who was raised in a Kwakiutl village. Jonaitis is author of Art of the Northern Tlingit. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.This book accompanies an exhibit of the art of the Kwakiutl Indians of Northern Vancouver Island and the mainland at the American Museum of Natural History. The fascination of the potlatch to our acquisitive culture should broaden interest in this book and its excellent text. The quality of the museum's Kwakiutl collection and the expert gathering of its key portions for the exhibition and this book were made possible more than a century ago as Franz Boas and George Hunt began collecting objects from the enduring cultural tradition of the Kwakiutl. It remains their masks, however, that have at once an artistic finesse and a ritual presence that make this book a beautiful catalog of the Kwakiutl.

A chronicle of the author's search for a civilization "reduced to its most basic expression."</p><p>"I hate travelling and explorers," famously declared Claude L�vi-Strauss, but how fortunate for readers that he should overcome his loathing to write about his experiences among the indigenous peoples of the Brazilian interior, including the Caduveo, Bororo, and Nambikwara tribes. Those who know L�vi-Strauss and <i>Tristes Tropiques</i> by reputation only will be pleasantly surprised by the intimate tone that colors even its most precise anthropological sections, as well as the autobiographical passages at the beginning, in which the author recounts how he fell into his career and how, shortly after the Nazis occupied Paris, he was forced to flee to America in a grueling sea voyage. Twenty-five black-and-white photographs of tribespeople, as well as numerous line drawings, accompany the text.Tristes Tropiques is one of the great books of our century," said Susan Sontag. "It is rigorous, subtle, and bold in thought. It is beauti-<br>fully written. And, like all great books, it bears an absolutely personal stamp; it speaks with a human voice."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tristes Tropiques was an immensely popular bestseller when it was first published in <br>France in 1955. Claude L�vi-Strauss's ground-<br>breaking study of the societies of a number of Amazonian peoples is a cornerstone of structural anthropology and an exploration by the author of his own intellectual roots as a professor of philosophy in Brazil before the Second World War, as a Jewish exile from Nazi-occupied Europe, and later as a world-renowned academic (he taught at New York's New School for Social Research and was French cultural attach� to the United States). L�vi-Strauss's central journey leads from the Amazon basin through the dense upland jungles of Brazil. There, among the Amerindian tribes--the Caduveo, Bororo, Nambikwara, and Tupi-Kawahib--he found "a human society reduced to its most basic expression." L�vi-Strauss's discussion of his fieldwork in Tristes Tropiques endures as a milestone of anthropology, but the book is also, in its brilliant diversions on other, more familiar cultures, a great work of literature, a vivid travelogue, and an engaging memoir--a demonstration of the marvelous mental agility of one of the century<br>'s most important thinkers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presented here is the translation by John and Doreen Weightman of the complete text of the revised French edition of 1968, together with the original photographs and illustrations. <br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

Andrews at Facebook.com/OfficialVCAndrews.<b>Prologue</b><br><br>Dear Paul,<br><br>I waited until the last minute to write this letter to you, mainly because I wasn't sure until now that I would do what my father asked and, with my twin sister, Gisselle, attend a private school for girls in Baton Rouge. Despite the promises I made to him, I have been having nightmares about it. I've seen the brochures of the school, which is called Greenwood. It does took beautiful, consisting of a grand structure containing the classrooms, an auditorium, a gym, and even an indoor pool; as well as three dormitory buildings, each with sprawling willow and oak trees in front; its own lake filled with lavender hyacinths; beautiful wooded grounds of red oak and hickory; clay tennis courts and ballfields; in short, everything anyone could want. I'm sure it has far better facilities and opportunities than I would have at our public school in New Orleans.<br><br>But it is a school attended by only the wealthiest, upper-class young women from the finest Creole families in Louisiana. I'm not prejudiced against wealthy people who come from highly respectable backgrounds, but I know I'll be surrounded by dozens and dozens of girls who have been brought up the way Gisselle has. They will think like her, dress like her, act like her, and they will make me feel like an outsider.<br><br>My father has great confidence in me. He thinks I can overcome any obstacles and I would be more than a match for any and all snobby girls I might encounter. He's so confident in my artistic talent that he believes the school will immediately recognize it and want to see me develop and succeed so they can get credit for it. I know he's just trying to help me shake off my doubts and fears.<br><br>But no matter how I feel about going to this school, I guess it's the best thing I could do at the moment, for it will at least get me away from my stepmother, Daphne.<br><br>When you came to visit us and you asked me if things had gotten better, I told you yes, but I wasn't telling you the whole truth. The truth was, I had almost been put away and forgotten in the mental institution my poor Uncle Jean, my father's brother, is in. My stepmother had conspired with the administrator to have me committed. With the help of a very nice but deeply disturbed young man named Lyle, I escaped and returned home. I told my father what had occurred and he and Daphne had a horrible argument. After things settled down, he came to me with the proposal to send me and Gisselle to Greenwood, the private school. I saw how important it was to him that we get away from Daphne, and I saw how happy she was that we were leaving.<br><br>So I am being pulled in two directions. On the one hand I am very nervous about attending Greenwood, but on the other I am glad to get away from what has become a very dark and dreary home. I feel bad about leaving my father. He seems to have grown years older in just a few months. Strands of gray have popped up here and there in his chestnut hair, and he doesn't stand as straight nor move as energetically as he did when I first arrived. I feel almost as if I'm deserting him, but he wants Gisselle and me to attend this private school and I want to make him happy and ease his burdens and tensions.<br><br>Gisselle hasn't once stopped complaining and whining. She is constantly threatening not to go to Greenwood. She moans and groans about having to be in a wheelchair and has everyone in the house running this way and that getting her things and satisfying her every whim. Not once did I ever hear her say the automobile accident was her and Martin's fault because of their smoking pot. Instead, she wants to blame the unfair world. I know the real reason she complains about going to Greenwood is that she's afraid she won't get what she wants whenever she wants it. If she was spoiled before, it was nothing compared to the way she is now. It makes it hard for me to feel sorry for her.<br><br>I have told her everything I know about our backgrounds, although she still won't accept the fact that our mother was a Cajun woman. Of course, she readily accepts all I tell her about Grandpere Jack, how he took advantage of our mother's pregnancy to make a bargain with Grandpere Dumas to sell Gisselle to the Dumases. He didn't know our mother was pregnant with twins, and Grandmere Catherine kept that fact from him until the day we were born, refusing to sell me too. I told Gisselle she could have easily been the one left in the bayou and I could have been the one brought up in New Orleans. That possibility puts the shudders into her and gets her to stop complaining for a while; but nevertheless, she has a way of getting under my skin and making me wish I had never left the bayou.<br><br>Of course, I often think of the bayou and the beautiful days we had together when Grandmere Catherine was still alive and you and I didn't know the truth about ourselves. Whoever said ignorance is bliss was saying the truth, especially when it comes to you and me. I know it's been harder for you to face up to it. You, perhaps more than I, have had to live with lies and deceit, but if I've learned anything, it's that we must forgive and forget if we are to go on enjoying anything in this world.<br><br>Yes, I wish we weren't half brother and half sister, and yes, I would come running home to you and we would build our lives together in the bayou, which is where my heart really is; but this isn't the course Destiny has laid out for us. I want us to be forever friends as well as brother and sister, and now that Gisselle has met you, she wants the same. Every time I get a letter from you she insists on my reading it aloud, and whenever you make a reference to her or tell her hello, she brightens with interest. Although with Gisselle you can never tell if it's just a momentary whim.<br><br>I love your letters, but I can't help feeling a bit sad whenever I get them. I close my eyes and hear the symphony of cicadas or the owl calling. Sometimes I imagine I can actually smell Grandmere Catherine's cooking. Yesterday Nina made us a crawfish etouffee for lunch, just the way Grandmere Catherine used to make it, with a roux glazed with butter and sprinkled with chopped green onions. Of course, as soon as Gisselle heard it was a Cajun recipe, she hated it. Nina winked at me and we had a private laugh, for we both knew Gisselle had eaten it heartily before.<br><br>Anyway, I promise I will write to you as soon as we are settled in Greenwood and maybe shortly, if you are able, you will come to visit us. At least you will know where to write.<br><br>I'd like to hear about the bayou and the people there, especially Grandmere Catherine's old friends. Most of all I'd like to hear about you. I suppose a part of me wants to hear about Grandpere Jack too. Although it is hard for me to think of him and not think of the terrible things he has done. I imagine he's a pathetic old creature by now.<br><br>So many sad things have happened to us so soon in our lives. Maybe...maybe we've already had our share of hardships and misfortune and maybe the rest of our lives will be full of good and happy things. Am I a fool to think so?<br><br>I can just see you smiling at me with those darling blue eyes of yours twinkling.<br><br>It's a very warm night here tonight. The evening breeze carries the scent of the green bamboo, gardenias, and camellias up to me. It's one of those nights when every sound can be heard seemingly for miles and miles. Sitting by my window, I can hear the streetcar rattling along St. Charles Avenue, and somewhere in another house someone is playing a trumpet. It sounds so sad, and yet it sounds so beautiful.<br><br>Now there's a mourning dove on the upper galerie railing, moaning its sad cry. Grandmere Catherine used to say I must wish for something good for someone the first time I hear the dove at night and wish it quickly, otherwise the dove's sad note will bring hard luck to someone I love. It's a night for dreaming and for making wishes. I'll make one for you.<br><br>Go out and call to the marsh hawk for me. And then make a wish for me.<br><br>As always,<br><br>Love, Ruby<br><br><b>Chapter 1: First Day</b><br><br>The rap, rap, rapping of a woodpecker woke me out of a restless sleep. I had been awake for most of the night, tossing and turning with worry about what the next day would bring. Finally the weight of fatigue shut my eyes, and I felt myself falling into the world of twisted dreams, until once again I had a familiar nightmare. In it I was drifting in a pirogue through the swamp. The water was the color of dark tea. I had no pole; the current was taking me mysteriously along into the darkness draped with Spanish moss, ghostlike as it undulated in the slight breeze. Over the surface of the water, green snakes slithered, following my canoe. The luminous eyes of an owl peered at me with suspicion through the darkness as I drifted deeper and deeper into the swamp.<br><br>In this nightmare there was usually the sound of a baby crying. It was too young to form words, but the cry sounded very much like a call for "Mommy, Mommy." It drew me on, but usually I woke up from this terrible nightmare before I went much farther into the darkness. Last night, however, I passed my furthermost point and continued into the murky, black world.<br><br>The pirogue made a turn and moved a little faster until I could see the luminous bone-white outline of a skeleton pointing its long, thin forefinger ahead, urging me to look into the darkness, until finally I saw the baby all alone, left in a hammock on the front galerie of Grandpere Jack's shack.<br><br>The pirogue started to slow down and then, right before my eyes, Grandpere Jack's shack began to sink into the swamp. The baby's cries grew louder. I reached over the side of the pirogue to row myself along faster, but my hand became entangled in green snakes. The shack continued to sink.<br><br>"NO!" I screamed. Deeper and deeper into the murky, muddy water it sunk, until only the galerie and the baby in the hammock remained. She had a small face, the color of a pearl. I reached out as I drew closer, but just as I could finally take hold of the hammock, the galerie sunk too.<br><br>It was then that I heard the rapping of the woodpecker, and my eyes snapped open to see the morning sunlight seeping in around the curtains to light up the pearl-colored silk canopy above my dark pine queen-size bed. As if they were blooming, all the colors in the floral wallpaper brightened under the warm illumination as well. Even though I had barely slept, I was happy to wake up to so much sunshine, especially after my nightmare.<br><br>I sat up and scrubbed my face with my palms until I had wiped the Sandman's traces out of my eyes and cheeks, and then I took a deep breath and told myself to be strong and be ready and be hopeful. I turned toward the window when I heard the voices of the grounds staff as they fanned out to clip the hedges, weed the gardens, and sweep the banana leaves off the pool patio and tennis courts. My stepmother, Daphne, insisted that they always make the grounds and buildings look as if nothing had happened the night before, no matter how gusty the wind or hard the rain.<br><br>The night before I had chosen and laid out my clothing for traveling to our new school. Expecting my stepmother would scrutinize how I was dressed, I chose one of my longer skirts and matching blouses. Gisselle finally relented and permitted me to set out her things as well, although she went to sleep vowing never to get up. I could still hear her threats and vows echoing in my ears.<br><br>"I'd rather die in this bed," she whined, "then make this dreadful trip to Greenwood tomorrow. Whatever you choose for me will be what I will wear when I take my last breath. And it will be all your fault, too!" she declared, falling back histrionically in her bed.<br><br>No matter how long I might have lived with my twin sister, I never got used to how unlike we were despite our virtually duplicated faces and figures, eye and hair color. And it isn't only because of the differences in our upbringing, either. I am sure that even in our mother's womb we didn't get along.<br><br>"My fault? Why would it be my fault?"<br><br>She propped herself up on her elbows quickly.<br><br>"Because you've agreed to all this, and Daddy does whatever you agree to do. You should have argued and cried. You should have thrown a tantrum, You'd think you would know how to throw a tantrum by now. Haven't you learned anything from me since you ran away from the swamps?" she demanded.<br><br>Learn how to throw a tantrum? Learn how to be a spoiled brat is what she really meant, and that was one lesson I could do without, even though she thought she had been doing me a favor by teaching me to be more like her. I swallowed back my laughter, knowing it would just enrage her more.<br><br>"I'm doing what I think is best for everyone, Gisselle. I thought you understood. Daddy wants us to be away. He thinks it will make life easier here for Daphne and him and for us too. Especially after all that has happened!" I emphasized, my eyes as big as hers could be.<br><br>She sank back in her bed and pouted.<br><br>"I shouldn't have to do anything for anyone else. Not after what's happened to me. Everyone should be thinking of me first and my suffering," she moaned.<br><br>"It seems to me everyone does."<br><br>"Who does? Who?" she snapped, with sudden energy and strength. "Nina cooks what you like, not what I like. Daddy asks your opinions before he asks mine. Beau comes around to see you, not me! Why...why...even our half brother, Paul, writes only to you, never to me."<br><br>"He always sends his regards to you."<br><br>"But not a separate letter," she emphasized.<br><br>"You've never written one to him," I pointed out.<br><br>She considered this a moment. "Boys should write first."<br><br>"Boyfriends, maybe, but not a brother. With a brother, it doesn't matter who writes first."<br><br>"Then why doesn't he write to me?" she wailed.<br><br>"I'll tell him to," I promised.<br><br>"No you won't. If he won't do it on his own...then...he won't. I'll just lay here forever, left to stare at the ceiling as usual and wonder what everyone else is doing, what sort of fun they're having...you're having," she added sharply.<br><br>"You don't lay here wondering about anything, Gisselle," I said, finally unable to stave off a smile. "You go wherever you want, whenever you want. You merely have to snap your fingers and everyone jumps. Didn't Daddy buy the van just so you could be taken everywhere in your wheelchair?"<br><br>"I hate that van. And I hate being taken in the wheelchair. I look like something being delivered, like breads or...or...boxes of bananas. I won't go in it," she insisted.<br><br>Daddy had wanted to drive to Greenwood in Gisselle's van, but she vowed she wouldn't set foot in it. He wanted to use it because of all the things she had insisted on taking with her. She had had Wendy Williams, our maid, in her room for hours and hours packing everything, deliberately demanding the most insignificant things just to make it all that much more difficult. My pointing out to her that we had limited space in the dormitory and we had to wear uniforms didn't dissuade her.<br><br>"They'll make space for me. Daddy said they would do all that they could to accommodate me," she insisted. "And as for wearing uniforms...we'll see about that."<br><br>She wanted her stuffed animals -- each and every one -- her books and magazines, her photograph albums, almost her entire wardrobe, including all her shoes, and she even had Wendy pack every last thing from her vanity table!<br><br>"You'll be sorry when you come home for vacations," I warned her. "You won't have the things you want here, and then -- "<br><br>"And then I'll just send someone out to buy them for me," she replied smugly. Sud...</p><h2>Protestant Scholasticism: Essays in Reassessment (Studies in Christian History and Thought)</h2><p>Traditionally, Protestant theology between Luther&#39;s early reforming career and the dawn of the Enlightenment has been seen in terms of decline and fall into the wastelands of rationalism and scholastic speculation. In this volume a number of scholars question such an interpretation. The editors argue that the development of Post-Reformation Protestantism can only be understood when a proper historical model of doctrinal change is adopted. This historical concern underlies the subsequent studies of theologians such as Calvin, Beza, Olevian, Baxter and the two Turrentini. The result is a significantly different reading of the development of Protestant Orthodoxy, one which both challenges the older scholarly interpretations and cliches about the relationship of Protestantism to, among other things, scholasticism and rationalism, and which demonstrates the fruitfulness of the new, historical approach.

They're fast, often require only a skein or two of yarn, and make amazingly versatile gifts for friends and family. Small knits are also the perfect way to try something new--an unusual stitch pattern, wild multi-colored yarn, or even a touch of sparkle. Laura Nelkin is well-known for designing these fun-to-knit little projects introducing her students and fans to advanced techniques with her signature "You can do it!" enthusiasm. In her first book, she shares her 3 favorite types of knitting using wrapped stitches, lacework, and beads. Each chapter begins with a quick knitted cuff to lay the foundations, then gradually ramps up to more complicated designs. The result is an all-new collection of wearable, feminine knits with a slightly rustic aesthetic. Give them as gifts, stockpile for a chilly day, or dress up a casual outfit--these are knockout projects to enjoy knitting again and again.</p><p>Laura Nelkin, a prolific independent knitwear designer, graduated from Cornell with a degree in Apparel Design.

Visit her at www.nelkindesigns.com.chapter 1 <br> <br>Wrapped Stitches at Play <br> <br>My favorite way to design is to play. In this chapter I show you creative techniques I&#x2019;ve developed by playing with a simple stitch and manipulating it with extra wraps. If you are relatively new to knitting, this is the ideal chapter for us to begin exploring the art of knitting together. <br> <br>By wrapping the yarn more than once around your needle, you create an elongated stitch, opening up a world of design possibilities. Elongated stitches can travel a longer distance without puckering the fabric, which allows for unexpected cabling and texture techniques. In the Laxo Hat (page 25), for example, the elongated stitches are crossed in a pattern, creating a &#x201c;faux&#x201d; cable stitch that works perfectly with �hand-�dyed yarn. In the Bootsy Boot Toppers (page 29), the elongated stitches are crossed in multiples so that the stitch pattern resembles a woven fabric. The Folly Cloche (page 21) utilizes another trick in which the elongated stitches are twisted 360 degrees on the needle, creating a traveling &#x201c;cord&#x201d; of stitches. I stumbled across this possibility when my �double-�pointed needle got twisted around by mistake! <br> <br>What a blast playing with this technique is! I think I&#x2019;ve only scratched the surface of designing with wrapped stitches. <br> <br>1 <br> <br>Elongating Stitches <br> <br>To play with wrapped stitches, we first need to create an �extra-�long, or elongated, stitch. If you wanted your stitch to be longer, you could work it more loosely, but this would make it hard to keep your gauge even. Another way to handle this is to take the yarn and wind it two or even three times around the needle. (Typically, when you work a stitch, you only wrap the yarn around the needle once, right?) When you drop these wraps on the next row, you&#x2019;ve made a stitch that is twice or even three times the length of a &#x201c;regular&#x201d; stitch. Once you have an elongated stitch, there are many possibilities for playing with them. <br> <br>Wrapping Stitch Twice <br> <br>Insert the �right-�hand needle into the next stitch on the �left-�hand needle, wrap the yarn twice around the �right-�hand needle, at its widest circumference, and then complete the stitch as usual, either a knit or a purl stitch. <br> <br>Wrapping Stitch Three Times <br> <br>Insert the �right-�hand needle into the next stitch on the �left-�hand needle, wrap the yarn three times around the �right-�hand needle, at its widest circumference, and then complete the stitch as usual, either a knit or a purl stitch. <br> <br>Dropping Extra Wraps <br> <br>The most elementary way to work with wrapped stitches is to simply knit or purl them on the next row, which creates an open fabric. When you reach the extra wraps created in the previous row, slide the extra wrap(s) off the �left-�hand needle before working that stitch. <br> <br>Knit (or Purl) �Criss-�Cross 4 (6) <br> <br>This technique, as well as Opposite Purl �Criss-�Cross 4 (below), reorients multiple elongated stitches&#x2019; positions on the needles so that they �criss-�cross over each other. Slip 1 stitch purlwise (dropping the extra wraps) 4 (6) times onto the �right-�hand needle. With the �left-�hand needle pass the first 2 (3) slipped stitches over the last 2 (3) slipped stitches and onto the �left-�hand needle. Move the remaining 2 (3) slipped stitches onto the �left-�hand needle. Knit or purl these 4 (6) stitches. <br> <br>Opposite Purl �Criss-�Cross 4 <br> <br>Slip 1 stitch purlwise (dropping the extra wraps) 4 times onto the �right-�hand needle, move all 4 stitches back over to the �left-�hand needle. With the �right-�hand needle pass the first 2 slipped stitches over the last 2 slipped stitches, leaving them on the �left-�hand needle. Purl these 4 stitches. <br> <br>Across-�6 (4, 3) <br> <br>Use this technique to cross individual elongated stitches over each other. Drop the first stitch from the �left-�hand needle, leave it to the front of the work, and slip the next 4 (2, 1) stitches to the �right-�hand needle. Drop the next stitch, leaving it to the front of the work, and place the first stitch back onto the �left-�hand needle. Slip the 4 (2, 1) stitches from the �right-�hand needle back to the �left-�hand needle. Take the last dropped stitch and place it onto the �left-�hand needle. Knit these 6 (4, 3) stitches. Don&#x2019;t worry when dropping these stitches; since they have been elongated, they won&#x2019;t go anywhere. Just be careful when you pick them back up that the right leg of the stitch is to the front of the needle (i.e., don&#x2019;t twist it). <br> <br>Open �Split-�6 (4) <br> <br>This technique moves individual elongated stitches away from each other. Slip the next 2 (1) stitches onto the �right-�hand needle, drop the next stitch and leave to the front of the work, and slip 2 (1) stitches back to the �left-�hand needle. Pick up the dropped stitch, put it onto the �left-�hand needle, and knit these 3 (2) stitches. Drop the next stitch, leaving it to the front of the work, and slip the next 2 (1) stitches onto the �right-�hand needle. Pick up the dropped stitch and place it onto the �left-�hand needle, then slip 2 (1) stitches back to �left-�hand needle. Knit these 3 (2) stitches. <br> <br>A great starter project that introduces wrapped stitches, this funky <br> <br>cuff also highlights a favorite handmade button. You&#x2019;ll learn how to <br> <br>elongate stitches to create the pattern and an integrated buttonhole <br> <br>at the same time. How easy is that? <br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know about you, but I have �stashes&#x2014;�there are yarn, bead, <br> <br>and even button stashes.

If you wrap tightly, they will not slide on the needle. <br> <br>Wrap yarn around the widest circumference of the needle, not around the needle tip. <br> <br>When you have wrapped stitches on the needle, do not pull down on your work as this will collapse the stitches and prevent them from sliding easily! <br> <br>Do not count wraps as extra stitches. All the wraps can make it difficult to check your stitch numbers on rows in which elongated stitches are worked.

Wealthy patrons who commissioned work from these artists often spared no expense in the presentation of their personal prayer books, or 'books of hours', from detailed decoration to luxurious bindings and embroidery.<br> This enchanting illuminated manuscript was painted by the Master of the David Scenes in the Grimani Breviary (known as the David Master), one of the renowned Flemish illuminators in the sixteenth century. Every page of the manuscript is exquisitely decorated. Fine architectural interiors, gorgeous landscapes and detailed city scenes, each one depicting a narrative, form the subjects of three full-size illuminations and forty-two full-page miniatures. There are floral borders on a gold ground or historiated borders in the Flemish and Italian style on every page. It is one of the finest examples of medieval illumination in a personal prayer book and the most copiously illustrated work of the David Master to survive.<br> The manuscript owes its name to the French Queen, Marie de' Medici, widow of King Henri IV. For a time she went into exile in Brussels, where she is thought to have acquired the manuscript before moving again to Cologne. An inscription in English states that she left the book of hours in this city, and it is here that an English manuscript collector, Francis Douce, may have acquired the book and eventually donated it to the Bodleian Library.<br> Together with a scholarly introduction that gives an overview of Flemish illumination and examines each of the illustrations in detail, this full-colour facsimile limited edition, bound in linen, faithfully reproduces all 176 pages of the original manuscript.

Scholars have chipped away at various aspects of Ellmann&#x2019;s impressive edifice but have failed to construct anything that might stand alongside it. The Years of Bloom is arguably the most important work of Joyce biography since Ellmann. Based on extensive scrutiny of previously unused Italian sources and informed by the author&#x2019;s intimate knowledge of the culture and dialect of Trieste, The Years of Bloom documents a fertile period in Joyce&#x2019;s life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While living in Trieste, Joyce wrote most of the stories in Dubliners, turned Stephen Hero into A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and began Ulysses. Echoes and influences of Trieste are rife throughout Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. Though Trieste had become a sleepy backwater by the time Ellmann visited there in the 1950s, McCourt shows that the city was a teeming imperial port, intensely cosmopolitan and polyglot, during the approximately twelve years Joyce lived there in the waning years of the Habsburg Empire.&nbsp; It was there that Joyce experienced the various cultures of central Europe and the eastern Mediterranean. He met many Jews, who collectively provided much of the material for the character of Leopold Bloom. He encountered continental socialism, Italian Irredentism, Futurism, and various other political and artistic forces whose subtle influences McCourt traces with literary grace and scholarly rigour. The Years of Bloom, a rare landmark in the crowded terrain of Joyce studies, will instantly take its place as a standard work.<br></p><p>John McCourt was born and educated in Dublin. Since 1991 he has lived in Trieste, Italy, where he teaches at the University of Trieste and where he founded and directs the annual Trieste Joyce School. He is author of an illustrated biography of Joyce, <i>James Joyce: A Passionate Exile</i> as well as <i>Dubliners: A Guide to Text Analysis</i> and, with Renzo Crivelli, <i>Joyce in Svevo&#x2019;s Garden.</i><br>If we regard biography as a kind of archeology, Joyce's Richard Leakey is unquestionably Richard Ellman, whose 1959 opus James Joyce established the terrain for all future biographies of the great Irish writer. And there have been many. Few, however, quite measure up to McCourt's informative, lucid and wholly engaging record of Joyce in Trieste, which in Joyce's day was as polyglot as Ulysses, as multicultural as any cosmopolitan city of today. Firmly in control of his subject and material, McCourt effortlessly interlaces the details of everyday lifeAmarital storms, economic worries, work habitsAwith larger historical and cultural concerns: Jewish life, the emergence of the futurists, socialist politics. In this milieu, the alchemy of Joyce's most potent art transformed many of the people, places and incidents of Trieste into important sections of Ulysses, which Joyce himself described as "the epic of two races (Israel and Ireland)." Laboring in relative obscurity, Joyce struggled not only with Leopold Bloom, but also with timid publishers who balked when it came to releasing Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. While honoring the work of his predecessors in Joyce scholarship, McCourt (who was born and educated in Dublin and now teaches at the University of Trieste) also examines material that was until recently unused or unavailable. This, along with his understanding of the culture and dialect of the once-vibrant port city, deepens our appreciation of Trieste both as a crossroads of cultures and as a profound influence on Joyce's thinking and writing.

Many pastors and other church leaders, like it or not, struggle with ambition. In this book Craig Hill shows how the New Testament can help Christian leaders deal with this problem honestly and faithfully.<br><br> Hill examines such passages as the Christ Hymn in Philippians 2 to show how New Testament authors helped early Christians construct their identity in ways that overturned conventional status structures and hierarchies. Status and ambition, Hill says, are not often addressed forthrightly in the church, as Christians either secretly indulge those impulses or feebly try to quash them. Hill's<i>Servant of All</i>&nbsp;will help Christian leaders reconcile their human aspirations and their spirituality, empowering them to minister with integrity.</p><p><br><b>Craig C.

All of us who are caught up in institutions that foster competition, ambition, and self-assertion will find this study to be a bracing, challenging reminder of the true nature of our vocation, and of the character of the One who calls us."<br><br><b>Elaine Heath</b><br> "In this welcome volume Craig Hill invites readers&#x2014;let's make that&nbsp;<i>leaders</i>&#x2014;to an honest discussion about the problem of unchecked ambition and status-seeking in the church.

Everything was fine until the boy looked to the left and found himself staring at a row of candy bars.</p><p>"Daddy, can I have one?" he asked as he grabbed and held one up for his father to see.</p><p>"No, not now. We're going to have dinner as soon as we get home," the father replied. A look of concern flitted across the dad's face, and I soon discovered why.</p><p>At hearing <i>No</i>, the three-year-old began a seemingly well-rehearsed routine. The young boy pleaded and whined. The father hung tough for a few minutes, but his resolve crumbled when the young extortionist brought out the heavy artillery: a full-throated wail. "I want one," he screamed loud enough that everyone within fifty feet could hear.</p><p>The father held out for one more second and then caved in. "Oh, all right. You can choose one. Now stop screaming."</p><p>The boy defiantly picked out <i>two</i> candy bars and looked up to check out the response. The dad reminded his son that he had said <i>one</i>, and the wailing resumed. "Okay, okay, but no more," the father said in a loud whisper. Realizing he was on a roll, the kid grabbed a third candy bar. When the father reached down to take it away, the boy let out an ear-splitting shriek and started a Milky Way tug-of-war. The battle ended quickly, but the three-year-old was the clear victor: He left with three candy bars and his father left muttering and beaten. This boy not only won the candy bar skirmish, he learned an enduring lesson: <i>No</i> does not mean no. <i>No</i> signals that it's time to escalate.</p><p>Every parent is familiar with these battles. We console ourselves by thinking, It's only a candy bar, or, It's not worth having a meltdown. Unfortunately, the stakes get a lot higher as the years go by. I recently had a conversation with parents who gave their sixteen-year-old daughter permission to go on an unchaperoned trip to Mexico over spring break with a group of friends. They talked with me after attending one of my seminars on the teenage brain, which are based on my last book, <i>Why Do They Act That Way?</i></p><p>The mother spoke first. "We're really worried about what might happen on this spring break trip after listening to you tonight. Do you think we made a mistake?"</p><p>"Were you comfortable with your decision before tonight?" I responded.</p><p>"Not really," she answered. "We never thought it was a good idea. But now we're really worried."</p><p>"Why did you say yes?" I asked.</p><p>After exchanging uneasy glances, the father spoke. "We said no at first, but our daughter was relentless. When we found out that all her friends were going we finally gave in. We made a deal with her that she has to call us every day and check in. We also laid down the law about drinking, drugs, and sex."</p><p>"It sounds like you weren't comfortable with your decision even before you came here tonight. Am I right about that?"</p><p>"Yes, you're right," the mother blurted. "I'm worried sick about what might happen. I'll be holding my breath until she gets home." She looked at her husband. "I just hate being in this position. We either let her go with the other kids or she makes life miserable for months."</p><p>The spring break trip and the Milky Way battle have a lot in common. While the stakes are a lot higher for the parents of teenagers, the difficulty in saying no is the same. The importance of saying and sticking to No is the same as well.</p><p>Copyright � 2007 by David Walsh, PhD</p></p><h2>1968 in America: Music, Politics, Chaos, Counterculture, and the Shaping of a Generation</h2><p>Charles Kaiser&#x2019;s 1968 in America is widely recognized as one of the best historical accounts of the 1960s.

Rather than holding referenda on each major policy issue as some countries such as Switzerland do, we choose people-and empower them to choose others-to represent us, to consider alternatives, to use judgment, occasionally to take risks, ultimately to decide for us and to govern. We repose enormous trust in these individuals, yielding to them authority to spend huge sums and charging them with the conduct of affairs of state, including even the declaration of war. Over time, their character, ideas, and judgments, as well as the overall vindication or breach of this "special trust" by them, are an important determinant of whether we prosper or decline as a nation. This concept of "reposing special trust" is a reciprocal covenant in which the electorate yields part of its sovereignty in exchange for the official(s)' commitment to live up to certain rules-not to break the law, not to lie, cheat or steal or in any other way violate the public trust. We don't do this haphazardly. Understanding human failings, we built accountability into the concept and structured the branches of government and their relationship to us through such things as periodic elections and daily press scrutiny as the means to keep the ship of state on course; or at least to keep things from going too far wrong. When an official or a group has done something corrupt or foolish, our approach has been to enact new law to circumscribe the authority of public servants, to tighten the rules, to limit their freedom to act, or to increase their reporting responsibilities, in an effort to better assure against future sin or ineptitude. For most of our history, this idea of reposing special trust in others has worked well. At least we can say it has helped us avoid catastrophe, although it must be acknowledged that for the first 150 years, the government's role was a much smaller part of our lives. It didn't have the authority to get into very much trouble. As the scope of government has broadened and its power and influence have spread both at home and internationally, our country has been blessed with scores of men and women of superior intellect and an elevated sense of patriotism who have enabled us to keep the peace, win the wars and over time, prosper. Such men as Paul Nitze come to mind, a man who has devoted 50 years of his life to public service and made historic contributions to our victory in the cold war, the control and ultimate reduction of nuclear weapons and many other landmark achievements. This book is about my attempt to vindicate the special trust I was privileged to take on as an officer in the Marines, as a senior official of the Department of State and as a member of the White House staff for nine years, culminating in my appointment as President Reagan's National Security Adviser. I look back on my life as a great adventure, filled with challenge, controversy, risk, danger, and achievement, as well as failure and near-tragedy. It is all here-as objectively as I can recall it. With nine years distance from government and, I believe, a better perspective on the substantial changes over the past forty years in how it functions, I have tried to do two things in this book. The first is to record my version of history, relying on notes taken at the time and from extended reference to my personal papers from those years, held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, at the National Archives and at the National Security Council. My second goal is to convey through a hundred stories-from the jungles of Vietnam to the cloistered corridors of the Kremlin, from the Byzantine chambers of the Middle East to the pristine yet somewhat tarnished West Wing of the White House-how the concept of "reposing special trust and confidence" has been eroded and why. I will also add a word on how to restore the special trust to its original status as a covenant that has stood us successfully through more than two centuries of greatness and, if renewed, can enable us to vindicate the American role of leadership into the third. Finally, in the course of providing my comment on these temporal events, I hope to convey my belief in and understanding of a larger "special trust" we all enjoy. And that is the trust from God to develop ourselves to the limit of our endowment, to apply the skills thus honed to the benefit of others, and in all things to be humble.</p><p> FROM CHAPTER ONE: Early one afternoon in February 1987, without telling anyone where I was going, I left my office in Washington, D.C., got into my car, and went to look for a place to die. As I drove up Canal Road along the Potomac River, a terrible pall hung over me. I struggled with feelings of shame and despair, feelings that were more than just a state of mind. Strange physical sensations gripped me. I felt an acute pressure, as though the world were bearing down upon me, squeezing me into a ball that would grow smaller and smaller until at last it would violently implode. My toes and fingers began to tingle, and I found myself absurdly worrying that I might have an accident that would thwart my plans to kill myself. For this is what I fully intended to do. In two days, I would end my life, a life of accomplishment, recognition and service, a life full of blessings-loving family, good friends, useful work, years of promise still lying ahead. The life of a man with everything to live for. A life, therefore, that would compensate for the wrong I believed I had done my country. The trip this day was a reconnaissance mission. I had determined how and when to die; today I would determine where. I had served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 20 years; planning to the last detail for the execution of every operation had become a matter of habit. I yearned to die because I knew that dying was the right thing to do. Driving along the Potomac in the fading light of a cold winter day, I thought how fitting a river setting would be for my last moments. My wife, Jonny, and I had always loved the river; for years, we had dreamed of owning a house with a view overlooking the Potomac's rolling waters. I turned into Carderock recreational area, a large park located on a bluff above the Potomac just beyond the Beltway in Montgomery County, Maryland. The south end consists of ball fields and a number of covered pavilions for large parties. We had had a picnic there several years before with many of my classmates from the U.S. Naval Academy. As I circled the grounds, it occurred to me that the Park Police probably patrolled the south end so frequently that I would be discovered before the pills I intended to take would have time to act. I drove on. To the north, the park is natural wilderness, dotted with only occasional family-sized picnic areas. Trails wind through the woods and along the bluff overlooking the river. On weekends, the bluff is a popular place for rock climbers and Outward Bound veterans. One or two spots boast a 50 to 60-foot rappel. I left the car in the parking lot, bothered again by the thought that it would serve as a tipoff for the Park Police. I struck out northward on the trail, hoping to find a secluded spot overlooking the river but hidden from the view of passersby. Unfortunately, the terrain between the C&amp;O canal and the river narrows to no more than 200 yards in this area, and the number of small trails increases. In winter, there is no cover, so a person is visible almost anywhere. Dismayed, growing anxious, I clambered onto the rocks and began searching for likely hiding places. Surely somewhere in this vast space there was a concealed spot where a man could die in peace, undiscovered and undisturbed. I found one or two niches that I thought might work, and sat in each of them for five minutes or so, crouching awkwardly in my business suit and overcoat. But each time, I was flushed out by couples who were obviously seeking the same privacy, only for more constructive purposes. My sense of despair deepened. The park apparently would not work. The threat of discovery before I had achieved my goal was too great. The wind whipped through the trees and whistled past my head, stinging my eyes and bringing tears. In the gathering dusk, my heart weighed down, I headed back to the car. In my mind I turned over a handful of other possible scenarios for my death, but each had some drawback I could not overcome. Finally, reluctantly, I gave in to the truth-that what I really wanted to do was simply to go to sleep as always with Jonny-and not wake up. The thought of having her discover me in the morning gave me pause, yet I selfishly rationalized that at least in the years to come, she might be comforted by the fact that I had wanted to be with her to the very end. What was a man like myself doing in that desolate park on that gray day, contemplating and planning his own demise? I was a prominent and respected figure in the nation's capital. I had been a highly-placed government official-National Security Adviser to President Ronald Reagan. Fourteen months earlier, I had left that post on a high note of achievement that included helping to negotiate the first reductions in U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons in history. Now privately in residence at a Washington think tank, I was still much in demand on the lecture circuit, in academia and in media circles for my knowledge of foreign policy. Over 30 years, I had built up a career and reputation that placed me among the top ranks of the nation's foreign policy professionals, which brought me power, status and regard. A few short months before, my future had appeared only bright. What could have happened to make me so determined to end my life? What could have happened to alter everything, to make me so anxious, to plunge me into the abyss of suicidal depression? Before that February of 1987, 1 had never imagined suicide as a conceivable act-for me or for any other McFarlane. If I had even contemplated its possibility, it would have been solely in the military tradition, to prevent being caught in a compromising situation as a prisoner -- self-destruction as a lesser evil than betrayal. Otherwise, like most people, I would have thought of suicide as an irrational act, the last refuge of the hopeless. Yet in recent days, the thought of taking my own life had overpowered me; it had gripped me with an unassailable logic and had taken on legitimacy as a just and fitting duty-the right thing to do. After weeks of deepening anguish and despair, it had come to me with an illuminating clarity from the most distant corner of my mind. The spiritual pulse was clear: "Go ahead. This is the way." Not the way out-out of my predicament, out of the spotlight in whose glare I stood exposed, out of the hearings and the news reports and the gossip columns, out of the sidelong glances of strangers in the street, out of life. I was not looking for escape, not that. But for the way to make things right. For nearly 30 years, I had been a public servant, dedicating my life's labors to the good of my country in the manner of my father before me. I had shaped my life according to the principles taught me first by him, then re-emphasized at the U.S. Naval Academy, and finally by the U.S. Marine Corps. "Duty, honor, country"-these were the real values I had honestly striven to sustain in all my endeavors, the absolutes I cherished and wished to uphold. In the course of my career, I had risen steadily from one position of trust to another, first through the Marine Corps, and then in government, where I had ultimately chosen to concentrate my skills. I had worked hard, believing what I was doing was not simply work, not primarily a career, but over and above all service, a genuine dedication of myself, my work, my life to the good of the country and its people. For this, I had been generously rewarded. I had left government at the zenith of my career, believing I had a great many more contributions to make even from the private sector. But now, everything seemed in jeopardy-my future, the government, the country. And I believed that for this, I was responsible. I believed the Iran-contra scandal, which had in the last three months all but engulfed the Reagan administration, and by extension the country, was all my fault. Certainly the "judges" of Washington-from the broadcast bureaus to the halls of Capitol Hill-said so. Since the previous November, I had appeared time and again before the congressional committees investigating the so-called arms-for-hostages deal by means of which the President and his men had sought to rescue the seven Americans then held captive by Shia Muslim terrorists in Beirut. I had told the presidentially-appointed Tower Board, which was also looking into the affair, the story of how our approach to Iran had begun while I was National Security Adviser, and how it had gone astray after I left the government. I had appeared on Nightline, the Today show, the CBS Moming News and countless other television news shows, and granted a dozen newspaper interviews, to explain that we had never intended a simple ransom arrangement; that our goals at the beginning had been larger, geostrategic, aimed at finding an opening to pragmatic elements in the regime of the fanatically anti-American Ayatollah Khomeini, an opening to people who might ultimately replace him. The trouble was, this was not what the journalists wanted to hear, and so the stories were always boiled down to a simple equation: arms-for-hostages, Reagan Deals with Terrorists. And the trouble was, I was the only one talking. No one else had come forward to back me up. Not the President who had approved and backed the Iran initiative from the very beginning. Not the Secretaries of State and Defense, George Shultz and Caspar Weinberger, who had known of all the developments.

McBrien provides the first one-volume compendium of the saints since the classic seventeenth-century work by Alban Butler. Featuring fascinating profiles of over six hundred saints, blesseds, and holy people, <em>Lives of the Saints</em> traces the paths and politics by which saints have been chosen over the centuries. Also included are concise histories of the various schools of Christian spirituality inspired by the saints' lives and their teachings.</p><p>In addition to offering a contemporary account of the saints, McBrien recognizes that there is a more universal understanding of sanctity: Catholics whose holiness has not yet been formally acclaimed, such as Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton, Mother Teresa, Thea Bowman, and Oscar Romero; non-Catholic Christians who have been recognized and celebrated by other churches, such as Martin Luther, John Donne, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Dag Hammarskj�ld, Albert Schweitzer, Stephen Biko, and Martin Luther King Jr.; and non-Christians such as Abraham Heschel and Mohandas Ghandi. McBrien also addresses the political nature of the canonization process and argues that there is a need to expand the ranks of saints to properly include women, Asians, Africans, married people, and those who identify with the poor and the oppressed.</p><p>With brief biographical portraits of the saints arranged according to the church calendar, <em>Lives of the Saints</em> is a remarkable reference source and, through its extensive biographies that are liturgically arranged by months and days, a valuable aid to devotion. Comprehensive, highly accessible, illustrated throughout, and including a bib-liography and glossary, <em>Lives of the Saints</em> captures these remarkable lives and powerfully reveals how they have transformed Christianity and the world.</p></p><p><i>Lives of the Saints</i> is a go-get-it-now book, an I've-been-waiting-for-this book, a thank-God-it's-on-good-paper-cause-I'll-still-be-reading-this-10-years-from-now book. Believers are drawn to saints because their witness and their teachings are inseparable: saints are the ones who lived what they believed. And we hope that, by learning about saints and meditating upon them, our own beliefs and actions will become more integrated. Author Richard McBrien, a professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame and author of the equally indispensable <i>Lives of the Popes</i>, is particularly interested in the relationship between the lives of individual saints and the life of the Church. In his preface to <i>Lives of the Saints</i>, and in its excellent essays about the history of sainthood, veneration, and the process of canonization, he repeatedly asks: "What do the saints tell us, individually and collectively, not only about the character of Christian discipleship, but about the meaning of human existence itself? And what does the action of the Church in proclaiming or canonizing various types of Christians as saints disclose about the fundamental religious values of the Church itself?" <i>Lives of the Saints</i> also includes biographical sketches organized by feast day (January 1 is Mary, Mother of God; December 31 is Pope Sylvester I). The book's clear structure and simple style ensure that it will serve many readers' needs: it may be used as a reference or as a devotional, or it may be read straight through. In any case, it will help Christians (or any interested reader) address what McBrien calls "the question of sanctity," a question that lies at the heart of all of our lives: "In what does a human life fully consist?" he asks. "What does it mean not only to be 'good,' but to be 'really good,' even outstandingly so?" <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>Richard P.

Original.</p><p>Pamela Sargent and George Zebrowski are both Nebula Award winners and have won many other awards for their work.<p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> As Captain Garth brought the <i>U.S.S. Heisenberg</i> out of warp and prepared to enter standard orbit around Axanar, the ship's helmsman shouted, "There's a Romulan vessel in orbit around the planet!" </p><p> On the bridge viewscreen, the winged shape of a Romulan vessel, a raptor hovering over its prey, was now clearly visible against the pale blue orb of Axanar. </p><p> Garth stood up from his command chair and said calmly, "Prepare to retreat. Go to maximum warp." </p><p> "Retreat?" his first officer asked, watching Garth with a look of apprehension in his dark, almond-shaped eyes. </p><p> "Yes, retreat. At once!" There was no doubt in Garth's voice. </p><p> The <i>Heisenberg</i> accelerated beyond the orbital velocity toward which it had been slowing, outpaced the pull of the planet's gravitational well in a wide curve, and shot into warp. </p><p> "The Romulan is chasing us," the helmsman said softly, "and we can't outrun it." </p><p> Garth glanced back at his communications officer, a green-skinned but nonetheless beautiful woman with a cap of short dark hair. "Lieutenant," Garth said, "send a subspace message to Starbase at Tau Ceti, informing them of the Romulan presence." </p><p> "Yes, sir," the young woman replied. </p><p> As the <i>Heisenberg</i> went to maximum warp, the Romulan vessel kept pace. Ten hours passed while Garth sat at his station, silent and unmoving, an enigma to his officers and crew, all of whom knew that the Romulan battle cruiser could not only pace their ship but also match its firepower. </p><p> Was their captain simply trying to avoid a battle? From his navigator's station, James Kirk turned in his seat and looked aft at Garth, but could read nothing in his commanding officer's cold blue eyes and impassive face. </p><p> In the tenth hour, the Klingon vessel, straining at the limits of its warp drive, began to overtake the <i>Heisenberg.</i> </p><p> <i>"Captain Garth,"</i> a voice called out. Kirk raised his eyes to the viewscreen as the face of a Romulan captain appeared, looking very much like Mr. Spock. <i>"I know that you are receiving my message. Drop out of warp and surrender, or we will destroy your ship."</i> </p><p> "I hear you," Garth replied. Kirk turned toward the command station for a moment and saw that Captain Garth was smiling. </p><p> <i>"Drop out of warp and surrender,"</i> the Romulan captain repeated, and then the image on the screen faded out. </p><p> "Bridge to engineering," Garth said. "I am ordering a complete and immediate warp shutdown." </p><p> <i>"We canna do that, Captain,"</i> one of the officers in engineering called out over the intercom. <i>"The engines canna take it. We'll be at their mercy if we --"</i> </p><p> "Those are my orders," Garth said. "Shut it down now." </p><p> <i>"Captain --"</i> </p><p> "Now!" </p><p> The <i>Heisenberg</i> dropped out of warp, and Kirk realized that they were suddenly behind the Romulan vessel, which had come out of warp well ahead of Garth's ship. The Romulans would be confused now, seeing the Federation starship disappear without any of the usual deceleration signatures on their scan. But very soon the enemy would confirm that the <i>Heisenberg</i> was behind them, and the Romulan commander would open fire. </p><p> Garth would not fire upon the Romulans first; Kirk was sure of that. He would honor the book and wait until he was sure that his vessel was about to be attacked. </p><p> On the bridge viewscreen, the Romulan starship appeared. </p><p> Kirk noted the readings on his console. "Captain," he said, "enemy screen is down." </p><p> "Fire!" Garth shouted, knowing that the Romulan commander was about to do the same. </p><p> Kirk and the helmsman opened fire. </p><p> The Klingon cruiser blossomed into flame -- </p><p> -- and Kirk awoke from his dream, with the fireball still in his brain... </p><p> He lay on his bed in the captain's quarters of the <i>Enterprise,</i> reflecting on the exactitude of his recurring dream and the meaning of past events. </p><p> Some years earlier, Captain Garth, the legendary Starfleet officer, had taken his starship to Axanar to stop an extremely bloody civil war between the two colonial settlements on that planet. At the heart of the conflict, Garth had discovered the presence of a Romulan mission. The Romulans had seen an opportunity to seize control of this star system near Tau Ceti, and thereby to encroach upon Federation space; the arrival of their battle cruiser had promised victory to one side, which could then hope to rule Axanar under Romulan patronage. </p><p> But inexplicably, Garth had ordered his starship to flee, and the Romulan vessel had given chase, its commander clearly fearful that the Federation vessel would alert Starfleet. The Romulans could not have understood or guessed at what Garth was up to, but could only hope to catch and destroy his vessel before it could send off a subspace alarm to the nearest starbase. </p><p> Kirk had studied the entire incident at Starfleet Academy. Garth of Izar had been the kind of officer destined to become a famed and admired figure, one whose military exploits were required reading and whose writings were part of the Academy's curriculum. After a ten-hour pursuit at top warp speed, with the Klingon cruiser gaining on the Federation vessel, Garth had executed what later became famous as the Cochrane deceleration maneuver. Under certain circumstances, although with a risk of some damage to the engines, warp drive could be suddenly shut down. A starship being chased by an enemy vessel would drop back and then abruptly appear behind her pursuers, prepared to fire upon an enemy baffled by the sudden disappearance of its prey. That was another tricky part of this maneuver, firing before the enemy ship could put up its shields. The decisive tactical advantage of reappearing without warning behind the enemy was worth the risk of damage from the sudden shutdown of the drive. </p><p> That was all there had ever been to the so-called Battle of Axanar, Kirk thought as he came fully awake. He often dreamed of Captain Garth's maneuver, and his dream was usually as accurate as the account that he had studied at the Academy, except in a few particulars. The Klingon captain of the battle cruiser could not have been Koloth, since he was not yet a captain at the time, and would live to challenge Kirk on the <i>Enterprise</i> on more than one occasion, most notably on Deep Space Station K-7. The first officer on the Heisenberg's bridge would also not have been the stocky, dark-haired man Kirk saw in his dream: Dr. Donald Cory, the governor of the asylum and penal colony on Elba II. And the communications officer with Garth at Axanar, according to records, had not been a green-skinned Orion, as was the woman in Kirk's dream; the officer he had dreamed of looked exactly like the ill-fated Marta, one of the inmates Kirk had encountered during his mission to Elba II a couple of years ago. </p><p> He thought of that unfortunate woman for a moment; the serum he had brought to Elba II, that had promised a cure for the few criminally insane inmates of the asylum, might have helped poor Marta control and conquer her murderous impulses and heal her tormented mind. </p><p> He pushed his memories of Elba II aside. </p><p> Garth's deceleration maneuver, Kirk mused, had possessed great tactical beauty, concealing a completely unexpected action. What a pity that, in all likelihood, it could only be done once. Now no one in command of a starship-class vessel would be taken in by such a ruse, which amounted to nothing more than being fooled into outpacing one's prey. </p><p> As he lay in bed, with some minutes left before he had to rise and prepare for return to duty, Kirk wondered again whether there might be some situation in which Garth's inspired move might be made to work again, if only one more time, before that particular circumstance also became so well known that it could never be repeated. It was a game that he played with himself, trying to summon a set of conditions in which the Cochrane Deceleration Maneuver might still succeed. He had once dreamed that he had found the answer, but could not remember what had seemed so clear in his dream. </p><p> As a consequence of Captain Garth's action, the warring colonies on Axanar had finally made peace; without the Klingon presence to tip the balance of power in favor of one side, the two antagonists had put aside their differences and signed perpetual accords. Kirk, although still a cadet, had shown enough promise to be chosen as a member of the Federation's peacemaking delegation to the planet, for which he had been honored with the Palm Leaf of the Axanar Peace Mission. </p><p> Kirk's time on Axanar had marked the beginning of his career as a Starfleet officer. It had also been the last great accomplishment on record of the supremely gifted Garth. Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad; that was part of Garth's story, too. </p><p> As he got up and began to dress, Kirk thought of the legends that had later grown up around the Axanar crisis. Garth's maneuver had been of short duration, but many tales stretched the pursuit of his starship across the whole quadrant, while the resolution of Axanar's civil war was often described as a major Federation victory, with Garth leading the victorious Starfleet forces. </p><p> Had Garth known that his destruction of the Klingon vessel would also defuse the civil war on Axanar? Historians liked to debate that one, but the man who might have answered the question directly was beyond questioning -- at least he had been up to now. Kirk suspected that Captain Garth, had he been able, might have answered modestly by saying that he had not planned for any such result, had perhaps only guessed at how the struggle on Axanar might end, and had simply hoped for the best. Things might have turned out differently, with the two factions continuing their struggle even without a Klingon presence. </p><p> Kirk let out his breath as he straightened the sleeves of his uniform. He might soon be able to ask any questions he liked of the man he had so admired during his Academy days and had then come to fear during their violent encounter in the asylum on Elba II. </p><p> Garth, according to a recent message from Admiral Jos� Mendez, was now in full recovery after his nearly two-year course of treatment. Dr. Cory had released him from the asylum at Elba II; indeed, with the success of the new serum and other innovative therapies, Cory was certain that the few remaining inmates of Elba II would soon be capable of leading normal and constructive lives. The governor would see the time when his asylum for criminally insane humanoids would at last be closed for good. Mendez was certain that Kirk would welcome the news. </p><p> Kirk was grateful for the message, but another question had immediately come to him: What kind of life could there now be for Garth of Izar, who had already lived one life as one of Starfleet's most brilliant officers and another as a murderous madman? Had his therapy healed him, or only made him into a man for whom there was no place, who would have to live on the margins of a society that might forever distrust him? </p><p><br> The new yeoman, Lesley Wodehouse, was waiting for Kirk when he came to the bridge of the <i>Enterprise.</i> The young woman had been on duty for only fourteen days, but Kirk had already come to appreciate her efficiency. Before he could ask for one, she had handed him a cup of coffee; by the time he was seated at his station, she had asked Lieutenant Uhura to call up a subspace message from Admiral Mendez, which had come in only a few moments ago. </p><p> <i>"Admiral Jos� Mendez to Captain James T. Kirk,"</i> the voice said over the comm. <i>"Just a message to let you know that I'm forwarding a petition we received from Captain Garth of Izar to you."</i> Kirk leaned forward, struck by the coincidence of hearing about the man who had so recently been on his mind. <i>"He's fully recovered now, and has been meeting with me and with other officers at Starfleet headquarters. As soon as you've looked over Captain Garth's petition, get back to me -- I want to discuss it with you in more detail. Mendez out."</i> </p><p> Garth's petition was marked confidential and attached to the message in text form. Kirk was about to open the file when Yeoman Wodehouse murmured, "Garth of Izar -- I remember reading about his exploits. There doesn't seem to be much on the record about his later life, only the fact that he was relieved from his command after a mission to Antos IV and sent to a medical facility for treatment." </p><p> "That is so," Commander Spock said from his computer station. "In fact, the captain and I had an encounter with Captain Garth nearly two years ago, on Elba II." </p><p> "Elba II?" The redhaired yeoman frowned. "But isn't that --" </p><p> "-- the asylum for the criminally insane," Kirk finished. "Garth of Izar was an inmate there at the time I was ordered to Elba II with a new drug that promised a complete cure, when used with other treatments." </p><p> "Obviously the treatment was successful," Ensign Pavel Chekov said from his navigator's station, "since he has been released." </p><p> "So that was where he was sent after being relieved from command?" Yeoman Wodehouse asked. </p><p> "I'd better start at the beginning," Kirk said. "A few years ago, Captain Garth and his starship crew were sent on a mission to Antos IV. When he got there and beamed down to the surface, he was horribly injured in an accident caused by a transporter malfunction. The Antosians were able to heal Garth, but along with the cure, they taught him the techniques of cellular metamorphosis. Garth left the surface of Antos IV able to take on any shape he wished. He then ordered his crew to destroy the Antosians and their world." </p><p> "But why?" the yeoman asked. "We've always assumed that the Antosians are one of the most peaceful races in the galaxy." </p><p> "We do not know why Garth acted as he did," Spock replied, "but his officers refused to obey the order. By the time they were able to gain control of their ship, Captain Garth had killed his first and second officers. He called their actions mutiny, but given that his medical officer later claimed that Garth was mentally ill and had to be removed from command, his officers were considered justified in their actions, and the charge of mutiny was posthumously erased from their records." </p><p> "He was sent to Elba II," Kirk continued, "and it was expected that he would be confined there for the rest of his life. Fortunately, a new serum was developed that promised to cure even the most seriously ill and dangerous inmates. I was sent on a mission to deliver that drug to the medical staff. What I didn't realize until Spock and I had beamed down to the asylum was that Garth had assumed the appearance of Dr. Cory, the governor, and taken over the place. His objective was to force Spock and me to help him gain command of the <i>Enterprise."</i> </p><p> "We were unarmed," Spock said, "and it was not possible for Lieutenant Commander Scott, who was left in command of our ship, to beam us up, since he could not penetrate the force field surrounding the asylum without risking the lives of everyone inside the facility. Captain Garth attempted to bend us to his will through threats, torture, an...</p></p><h2>Love Is Patient Romance Collection: True Love Takes Time in Nine Historical Novellas</h2><p>Enjoy the slow dance through the courtship of nine historical couples in the American west, including the territories of Arizona and Wyoming.

In one afterlife you may find that God is the size of a microbe and is unaware of your existence. In another, your creators are a species of dim-witted creatures who built us to figure out what they could not. In a different version of the afterlife you work as a background character in other people&#x2019;s dreams. Or you may find that God is a married couple struggling with discontent, or that the afterlife contains only those people whom you remember, or that the hereafter includes the thousands of previous gods who no longer attract followers. In some afterlives you are split into your different ages; in some you are forced to live with annoying versions of yourself that represent what you could have been; in others you are re-created from your credit card records and Internet history. David Eagleman proposes many versions of our purpose here; we are mobile robots for cosmic mapmakers, we are reunions for a scattered confederacy of atoms, we are experimental subjects for gods trying to understand what makes couples stick together.

Moments later, one of the officers is felled by a machete blow, and his rookie, female partner takes out her disgust and fury on the murderer, battering him to death. This is the intensely dramatic, wrenching beginning to the twelfth in Peter Robinson&#x2019;s award-winning and internationally bestselling Inspector Banks series. <br><br>The task of investigating Probationary PC Janet Taylor&#x2019;s actions falls to DI Annie Cabbot, Banks&#x2019;s lover. This complication to his love life unsettles Banks, but he keeps his mind on his job, one that becomes immeasurably more difficult when the bodies of other teenage girls are found buried in the torturer&#x2019;s garden. Who are these girls? Why weren&#x2019;t they all reported missing? These are difficult questions, yet the central question Banks has to answer is how much did the murderer&#x2019;s wife know? Was she, too, the victim of a sick and twisted man, as she claims, or was she an accomplice? <br><br>This compelling story is at its heart a deeply sensitive, astute, and ultimately unforgettable exploration of the nature and long-lasting effects of crime and of victimhood. Its intelligence, honesty, and moments of grace lift <i>Aftermath</i> out of the confines of genre fiction and place it in the first rank of novels on crime.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><b>Penzler Pick, October 2001:</b> The mystery novels of Peter Robinson (<i>Aftermath</i> is his 12th) are of increasing power and intensified intelligence. It's a dirty little secret of the crime-fiction genre that many of its writers simply spin their wheels, repeating over and over those old tricks which always have worked for them. They coast on past successes and repeat the formula hoping, if not assuming, that their fans won't notice.<p> Writers like Robinson, however, actually seem to grow in front of our eyes, delivering books of greater complexity each time. His previous two books, <i>Cold Is the Grave</i> and <i>In a Dry Season</i>, were novels of character and novels of crime, equally, and now <i>Aftermath</i> is here to reward his fans and new readers alike.</p><p> Like recent books by fellow English writers Reginald Hill, Val McDermid, and Stephen Booth, <i>Aftermath</i> centers upon a grim case in which attractive young girls have disappeared, victims of a cunning psychotic killer whose identity is well concealed behind a fa�ade of respectability. Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks of the Yorkshire Police is in charge of the case, but he's also got unavoidable personal distractions. His separated wife, Sandra, is pregnant by her lover, Sean, and wanting the divorce he's been dragging his heels over.</p><p> There is nothing cozy about the kind of English mysteries written by Peter Robinson, even if they do take place where picturesque rural villages make up the landscape. He's not afraid of gore or deviance, of violence, or of any of the baser emotions, and it's a raw old world behind the hedgerows and cottage walls. If <i>Aftermath</i> is your first taste of his tough-tender sensibility, it won't be surprising if you soon are hooked on the work of one of today's most accomplished practitioners of detective fiction. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p><p>One phone call from a concerned neighbor has inadvertently led police to Terence Payne, the elusive serial killer known only as "Chameleon." Now Payne is in custody, perhaps dying, and a long nightmare appears to be over at last. But is it?</p><p>For Alan Banks&#x2014;currently head of the local police force&#x2014;too many questions remain unanswered at the chamber of horrors the press will dub the "House of Payne." Because the darkness has not yet lifted, the casualties are still mounting . . . and there are still monsters loose in the world.</p><p>Showcasing the dark forces of human nature, master of suspense Peter Robinson is at the height of his storytelling powers in a novel that will leave readers guessing until the final page.</p></p><h2>Moon Michigan&#39;s Upper Peninsula (Moon Handbooks)</h2><p>Born-and-raised Michigander Paul Vachon provides an insider's view of the Upper Peninsula, from the rocky outcrop of Copper Peak in the Superior Upland to the meadows and forests of quiet Drummond Island.

This purpose has been research into the origin and history of particular topics that have not been fully covered in current literature. The result is the publication of three books by The Antique Collectors&#39; Club. The first book, &#39;Chatelaines - Utility to Glorious Extravagance&#39;, written with Nerylla Taunton (1994), included the first detailed research on this topic and is now considered the definitive work. The second, &#39;Boxes - Inside and Out&#39; (2006), covered every aspect of all types of boxes. These books have resulted in further newspaper reviews and magazine articles, as well as radio/television interviews. This third and current book, addresses the role of the watch as a fashion accessory, an aspect that has not previously been covered in detail.

His father, a brutal Irish nationalist, demands his children speak Gaelic at home whilst his mother, a softly spoken German emigrant who escaped Nazi Germany at the beginning of the war, encourages them to speak German. All Hugo wants to do is speak English. English is, after all, what the other children in Dublin speak. English is what they use when they hunt down Hugo (or Eichmann as they dub him) in the streets of Dublin, and English is what they use when they bring him to trial and execute him at a mock seaside court. Out of this fear and confusion Hugo tries to build a balanced view of the world, to turn the twisted logic of what he is told into truth. It is a journey that ends in liberation but not before this little boy has uncovered the dark and long-buried secrets that lie at the bottom of his parents&#39; wardrobe.</p><p>The son of a German mother and an Irish father, Hugo Hamilton grew up in Dublin in the 1950s wearing "lederhosen and Aran sweaters, smelling of rough wool and new leather, Irish on top and German below." His family spoke both German and Irish, but English was strictly forbidden--even uttering a few words of the cursed language was enough to earn an often brutal punishment from their father, a staunch Irish nationalist. His father maintained that "your home is your language" and insisted that they be a model Irish family and an example for others to follow. Hamilton and his siblings were not even permitted to play with children who did not speak Irish exclusively--a particular problem in a country where English is the primary language. Ironically, he was taunted mercilessly for his German heritage and children jeered him with cries of "Eichmann" and "Heil Hitler." He was even put on "trial" once by a gang of kids who sentenced him death by snowball firing squad. This confusing quest to discover his identity and to gain an understanding of his family history is at the heart of <i>The Speckled People</i>, a profoundly touching and beautifully written memoir. <p> His parents' secrecy concerning their own pasts only exacerbated his frustration, forcing Hamilton to cling to fragments of information gleaned secretly from hidden photographs and buried family relics. Written from the perspective of a child, Hamilton captures his feelings of confusion, guilt, and fear convincingly and with much humor and insight. Full of poetic passages, sharp observations, and the kind of subtle epiphanies that are best expressed by a child, the book is a joy to read. "When you're small you know nothing and when you grow up there are things you don't want to know," he writes. This memoir is Hamilton's attempt to reconcile the two. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>Hugo Hamilton was born and grew up in Dublin.

Growing up in Texas, she was married early to Benjamin Hagman and gave birth to her first child, Larry Hagman. She was divorced even more quickly. Martin left little Larry with her parents and took off for Hollywood. She didn&#39;t make a dent in the movie industry and was lured to New York where she found herself auditioning for Cole Porter and his new show &#34;Leave It to Me!&#34;. After she sang the bawdy &#34;My Heart Belongs to Daddy&#34;, she ended up on the cover of Life magazine. Six years later, she became the Toast of Broadway when she starred in &#34;South Pacific&#34;. After that, she flew as &#34;Peter Pan&#34;, yodeled in &#34;The Sound of Music&#34;, took &#34;Hello, Dolly!&#34; on the road and shared a four-poster with Robert Preston in &#34;I Do! I Do!&#34;. Her personal life was just as interesting: In NYC, she met and married Richard Halliday, a closeted upper-class homosexual who adored her, Broadway and interior decorating (though probably not in that order). They were a powerful twosome. There were rumors about Martin, too, being in a lesbian relationship with both Janet Gaynor and Jean Arthur. Peopled with legends like Ethel Merman, Ezio Pinza, Noel Coward and a starry cast of thousands, David Kaufman&#39;s &#34;Some Enchanted Evenings&#34; is the delectable story of the one and only Mary Martin, a woman who described herself as a chicken farmer from Texas only to become Peter Pan and capture America&#39;s heart.</p><p>DAVID KAUFMAN is the bestselling author of <i>Doris Day: The Untold Story of the Girl Next Door</i> as well as a long-time theater critic and contributor to <i>The New York Times, The Nation, </i>and <i>Vanity Fair. </i>He lives in New York City.<p><i>&#x201c;</i>Kaufman comes up with a solid, valuable portrait of one of the 20th century&#x2019;s most memorable actresses.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Washington Post</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>&#x201c;Reveals a much more complex and even baffling figure than Martin herself gave us in her memoir...

This book moves beyond our accepted notion of the oil painting on canvas to consider the term as both a literal and figurative surface upon which artists construct or construe the landscape as an intellectual, cultural, or physical entity. It provides an innovative reevaluation of traditional thought concerning the Hudson River School, Luminism, and artists of the Civil War era.<br><br>As interdisciplinary emphases are employed with increasing frequency in arts and humanities courses, the breadth and depth of topics covered in this collection will provide a much-needed text for scholars in American art history, nineteenth-century American studies, and landscape studies, in addition to serving as a complement to courses in American literature and culture.</p><p><p>NANCY SIEGEL is an associate professor of art history at Towson University and serves as a curatorial advisor to the Thomas Cole National Historic Site.</p>&#x201c;The Cultured Canvas is a provocative collection of essays, with many of them questioning conventionally held concepts in nineteenth-century American art.

He lives in northern Idaho.Resuscitation of a Hanged Man<br>1980He came there in the off-season. So much was off. All bets were off. The last deal was off. His timing was off, or he wouldn't have come here at this moment, and also every second arc lamp along the peninsular highway was switched off. He'd been through several states along the turnpikes, through weary tollgates and stained mechanical restaurants, and by now he felt as if he'd crossed a hostile foreign land to reach this fog with nobody in it, only yellow lights blinking and yellow signs wandering past the car's windows silently. There was a single fair-sized town on the peninsula, a place with more than one shopping center in it and boarded-up seafood stands strung along the roadside, and the traveller, whose name was Leonard English, thought he'd stop there for a drink, just one drink, before going on. But he was drawn into a very interesting conversation with a man whose face got to look more and more like a dead pig's face in the dim red light. What they were talking about really wasn't all that memorable--it was more the man's face--but the drinks got slippery and English's money was all wet by the time he got out of there, and as he made a U-turnthrough an intersection the world seemed to buckle beneath him and the car's hood flew up before the window. English held the wheel and jammed the brake, waiting for the rest of this earthquake, or this bombing or God's wrath, to destroy the town. A shriek, like the tearing of metal train wheels along metal rails, died away. Somebody was opening the door for him ... but he was opening the door for himself, and now he was getting out of the car. There wasn't any cataclysm. It was just a town at night, quiet and useless, with buildings that looked like big toys or false fronts lit by arc lamps and backed by a tremendous bleakness. Somehow his Volkswagen had climbed up onto a traffic island. The whole thing would have been embarrassing, but he couldn't seem to form any clear picture of what had happened. Blood ran down his forehead and blinded half his sight. The air reeked: the tank was ripped and twenty dollars' worth of gasoline covered the asphalt. In his imagination it burst into flames. A cabdriver stopped and came to stand beside him and said, "You made a wrong turn." English did not dispute this.&nbsp;<br>To reach his destination at the end of the Cape, English engaged the cabdriver's services, services he couldn't afford any more than he was going to be able to afford this accident."He gonna chadge you exry," the cabdriver said.Chadge? English guessed the driver was talking about the old man who'd towed his car away, but what was he trying to say? "Right," English said."You from Bwostin?" the cabbie asked him.This was just what the policeman had asked him amid the wreckage, saying <i>Boston</i> like <i>Bwostin.</i> "Mr. Leonard English," the officer had said. Looking right at English's Midwestern driver's license, he had inquired after his origins: "You from Bwostin?" "I just got here from Lawrence, Kansas," English told theofficer. <i>"Kansas?"</i> the officer said. "Lawrence, Kansas?"--and English said yes. A little later the officer said, "You're drunk. But I'm gonna let you off.""Drunk? I'm not drunk," English said."Yes you are, you most definitely are," the officer said, "or you wou'nt be arguing with me." With a certain vague tenderness, he was applying a Band-Aid to English's forehead.English said, "I'm a little tipsy. I don't understand what you're saying.""That's better," the officer said.English was glad when the policeman left him in the cabdriver's custody, because he felt cut off from the world here, and to be scrutinized by a powerful figure in a place he hadn't even seen in the daylight yet left him shaken. Properly speaking, this wasn't even a peninsula. He'd had to cross a large bridge to get here. It was an island. A place apart.And now, as they rattled toward this phony peninsula's other end, English was sitting up front with the cabdriver. English was dizzy, and on top of that there seemed to be an exhaust leak, but the driver kept saying, "You're A-OK now, brother." "No, I'm not," English said. They weren't in a taxicab. It was almost six in the morning and the driver was going in his station wagon to his home a couple of towns down the road, taking English dozens of miles out of his way for twenty dollars. "I like to drive," the cabbie said. He puffed on a joint wrapped in yellow paper.English turned it down. "Grass makes me feel kind of paranoid.""I don't get paranoid," the driver said. But he was a paranoid personality if English had ever seen one. "This beyond here, this is absolutely black," the driver said, pointing with the glowing end of his reefer ahead, to where the four-lane highway turned two-way. "No more lights, no more houses"--he drew a chestfulof smoke--"nuthin, nuthin, nuthin. We won't see no traffic. Not car one." Immediately the red taillights of another car shone ahead. "I think I know this guy." He stomped the gas. "I think this is Danny Moss"--pronounced Dyany Mwas--"is that a Toyota? Cheez, looka how fast this guy's running." They were doing eighty. "<i>We're</i> gonna catch you, Danny. <i>We're</i> gaining on this sucker." But they were falling behind. "Ain't that a Toyota?" he said. The red taillights ahead went right, and the cabdriver's gaze followed their course as he and his passenger sailed past the turn they'd taken. "Yeah, that's a Toyota! Yeah, that's him! Yeah, that's Danny Moss!"Actually, they hadn't come to any place of absolute blackness. In a little while the sun was up, burning without heat above the road, and before they reached Provincetown they sped through three or four more little villages, in one of which they stopped and had breakfast. It turned out that Phil, the driver, subscribed to the branch of historical thought characterized by a belief in extraterrestrial interference, previous highly advanced civilizations, and future global cataclysms, both human-made and geological. English now learned something about these things. "All the elemental phosphorus is gonna be like zero, completely gone. We'll be strangling each other in the streets for a little phosphorus," Phil said, "elemental phosphorus. The roads are gonna run with blood. Nobody even knows about it. Nobody's even surprised. Five thousand years ago on the earth they had a big cataclysm and a huge, what is it, whatyoucallit, <i>megadeath.</i> Partly because of running out of some of these elements you need in your body, like phosphorus." He got into a philosophical talk with their waitress and told her, "I think our world could really be some form of Hell, you know what I'm saying?" The waitress saw his point. "There's so much suffering here on earth," she said. Phil knew all the waitresses, and it was after nine when they got back on the road.English fell asleep. When he woke up, the route had gone strange. White dunes made walls on either side of them. European music came out of the radio. They drove through a drift of sand.In a few minutes his head was clear again, and he was looking at the sandy outskirts of the last town in America. The sun was shining above it now. A tower made of stone rose up in the distance. The seaside curved north, to their left, and the wooden buildings were laid out solid, bright and still as a painting, against the beach.They followed the road into town and lost sight of the harbor as they came down the main street of shops. Now there were pedestrians moving alongside them in the chilly sunshine. The traffic crawled. "This crowd is nothing compared to summer," Phil told him. Half the shops appeared closed, and English had a sense of people walking around here where they didn't belong, in an area that might have been abandoned after a panic. Three ungainly women--were they men, in bright skirts?--danced a parody of a chorus line by a tavern's door, arms around one another's shoulders. Passing along the walks and ambling down the middle of the street were people in Bermuda shorts and children eating ice-cream cones as if it weren't under 60 Fahrenheit today. On the lawn of the town hall, surrounded by grey pigeons and scattering crusts of bread out of a white paper bag, stood a woman who was very clearly not a woman but a man: as if a woman wore football shoulder pads and other bulky protection beneath her very modestly tailored dress. Another man in a dress was mailing a letter at the blue mailbox just six feet away. And a cross-dresser on roller skates loomed above two others sitting on a bench, patting his brittle wig lightly with one hand, the other hand on his hip, while laughter that couldn't be heard passed among them. A very tall woman, who might have been a man, talked with a bunch of grade-school childrenout in front of a bakery. English cleared his throat. He had a chance to look at everyone until he was sick of their faces, because the car wasn't getting anywhere.Phil smacked the horn, but nothing happened. "Horn don't work. This is making me apeshit. I'm gonna run some bastards over."They found the source of the traffic jam four blocks down, where a huge-bottomed transvestite comedian on the balcony of a cabaret-and-hotel delivered his Mae West impersonation for free. "Move over, honey!" he shouted down to a woman in a halted convertible. The woman ducked her head in embarrassment and put her hand on the arm of the man driving. Around them the shoppers and tourists, variously shocked and mesmerized, or curious and entertained, laughed at the comedian with his cascading platinum wig and his stupendous, unexplainable breasts. Later that night English would see someone being carried on a stretcher out of the side doors of this building and through the wet, falling snow to an ambulance. And he would think of this man on the balcony in his evening gown making jokes about his potbelly, gripping it with a hand that glittered with rings while flapping his huge false eyelashes, and English wouldn't feel equipped, he wouldn't feel grown-up enough, to be told the whole story about this town.&nbsp;<br>Phil knew any number of people in Provincetown. He was connected all up and down the Cape. Long before the Pilgrims, English gathered, long before the Indians, way back past the time of cataclysms, even before the golden age of the extraterrestrial star-wanderers who had mated with monkeys to produce us all, members of Phil's family had arrived here and opened small dark restaurants with steamy walls and radios chattering and yowling in the kitchen, and had applied for liquor licenses which to this day they were denied because the grudges againstthem, though small ones, were eternal. What all this meant was that English wouldn't have to go to a motel. Phil had a cousin who ran a rooming house, freshly painted white and spilling winter roses over a knee-high picket fence, where English could stay cheaply.Phil insisted on carrying English's suitcase up the long stairs through an atmosphere of mingled disinfectant and air-freshening spray into a room that was small but not cheerless. There were big orange ladybugs printed on the white curtains. A faintly discolored portrait of John F. Kennedy hung on the wall above the desk. The bathroom looked harmless--blue sink, blue toilet, blue tub scoured nearly white. "All right, hey, not bad," English assured Phil, but it had every quality of the end of the line.Now that they'd travelled together and English was one of the family, with his very own room in Phil's illustrious cousin's house, Phil wouldn't accept a fare. English had to follow him down the stairs and out to his half-disintegrated yellow station wagon, insisting. Then he accepted the twenty-dollar bill that English pressed on him, and gripped the new tenant's hand with his, the money caught between their palms. His eyes were moist. They were two of the same sort, men past thirty without a lot to recommend them; but this happened to English every day. He had a feeling they'd stay strangers.After Phil was gone, English lay on the bed awhile, but he couldn't sleep because it was daytime and also a little too quiet. He wondered if everybody was at work. Then he remembered that it was Sunday. They'd passed a church, he and Phil, as they'd inched in Phil's vehicle down to the end of Commercial Street, the street of shops, and then in the other direction down Bradford, now his street, the street of his home. English hadn't really noticed, but he thought it might have been a Catholic church. He thought he would go to Mass.In his first few hours on this dismal Cape, before he'd even seen the daylight here, he'd managed to smash his car and put himself in debt to a strange and probably larcenous auto body shop. The idea of a fresh start took on value and weight as he splashed water on his face and, lacking any kind of towel, dried it with the corner of his bedspread, uncovering in the process a bare mattress. If Mass hadn't started at ten, it would be starting soon, at eleven.&nbsp;<br>It took English only a few minutes to walk there--St. Peter's, a Catholic institution. He hadn't missed the service. Under a sky the color of iron, people were lugging themselves like laundry toward the big doors of the church. A black arrow outlined in silver directed English toward a side door if he wanted to confess his sins.In a small room next door to the administrative offices, he found a priest bidding goodbye to an old woman and cleaning his spectacles on the hem of his cassock. English backed away as she passed out of the place, and now it was his turn to sit in the wooden chair, separated from his confessor by a partition with little metal wheels.This moment seemed to have swooped down on him from nowhere. He'd tried several times recently to make a good confession, but he'd failed. The problem was that about a year ago he'd more or less attempted to take his own life, to kill himself, and couldn't get started telling why.The priest, a small, preoccupied man, made the sign of the cross and awaited the rote utterances, praying to himself in a rapid whisper.But English had only one thing to confess. "I'm new in town--excuse me ..." Violently he cleared his throat. Now he noticed the room was full of flowers.The priest stopped praying. "Yes. Well, young friend. New in town.""I wonder if--Father, can we dispense with the ... ?" English waved his hand around, and was embarrassed to find that this gesture included the confessional and the cross. He'd meant only the formalities, the ritual. What he wanted was plain absolution."It's a nice quiet time of year to come," Father said in a puzzled tone.English waited a minute. The flowers smelled terrible. "I just went crazy," he said. "I committed--I killed myself.""Uh, you ..." The priest looked up through the partition's screen as if only now beginning to see he wasn't by himself. "In what sense," he began, and didn't finish."What I mean is," English said, "not <i>killed. Tried,</i> I mean. I tried to hang myself.""I see," Father said, meaning, perhaps, that he didn't see.After a few seconds Father said, "Well then. You say you've tried to ... Is there something you've done about this? Have you sought help?""I am. I'm--I'm confessing.""But ..." The priest stalled again.English wondered how much time before Mass. Nobody else was behind him. "I mean ..." he said."Okay," the priest said. "Go on.""The thing is, I'm starting o...</p><h2>Memories of a Former Kid</h2><p>Reveals the humorous and touching memories of life through the seasons on a farm in Iowa during the 1920s and 1930s</p><p></p><h2>The Harvey Girls: Women Who Opened the West</h2><p>Interviews, historical research, and photos recreate the Harvey Girl experience of women who came to the west to work as waitresses, but many stayed and settled, founding cattle and mining towns.</p><p>Lesley Poling-Kempes is the author of five award winning books about the land and people of the American Southwest.

Even by our society&#x2019;s standards, the practice of things like BDSM is still very hush-hush, considered deviant sexual behavior that must be kept hidden. But the narrow view of what is thought of as &#x201c;normal&#x201d; sex&#x2014;a vanilla act performed by one man and one woman&#x2014;is more and more contested these days. And as Julie Peakman reveals, normal never really existed; for everyone, different kinds of sex have always offered myriad pleasures, and almost all sexual behaviors have traveled between acceptance and proscription.&nbsp;<i>The Pleasure&#x2019;s All Mine</i>&nbsp;examines two millennia of letters, diaries, court records, erotic books, medical texts, and more to explore the gamut of &#x201c;deviant&#x201d; sexual activity.<br> Delving into the specialized cultures of pain, necrophilia, and bestiality and the social world of plushies, furries, and life-size sex dolls, Peakman considers the changing attitudes toward these, as well as masturbation, &#x201c;golden showers,&#x201d; sadomasochism, homosexuals, transvestites, and transsexuals. She follows the history of each behavior through its original reception to its interpretation by sexologists and how it is viewed today, showing how previously acceptable behaviors now provoke social outrage, or vice versa. In addition, she questions why people have been and remain intolerant of other people&#x2019;s sexual preferences.<br> The first comprehensive history of sexual perversion and packed with both color and black and white images,&nbsp;<i>The Pleasure&#x2019;s All Mine</i>&nbsp;is a fascinating and sometimes shocking look at the evolution of our views on sex.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Julie Peakman </b>is a historian, author, and broadcaster who is renowned for her work on the history of sexuality.

As we read Callow we feel closer to that tormented genius. &#x2014;Olivier Bernier, Newsday. A Book-of-the-Month Club Alternate Selection.</p><p>More searchingly than any earlier biographer, Philip Callow explores the development of Van Gogh&#39;s genius and his emergence as an artist after early struggles to find a vocation, first in the world of art dealing and later as an evangelical missionary among Belgian miners. Using the skills and psychological insights of an accomplished novelist, and drawing upon new Van Gogh materials which have surfaced in the last two decades, Mr. Callow sets a turbulent life story firmly in historical context, including Vincent&#39;s desperate attempts to accept his repressive religious upbringing, and his unhappy experiences in love. Here is Van Gogh&#39;s life in all its tumult, a portrait of a legend breaking out of the triumph and confusion of nineteenth-century culture - at the same time representing it uniquely. This is perhaps the story of a saint, certainly a hero of art.Philip Callow's biographies of D. H. Lawrence, <i>Son and Lover</i> and <i>Body of Truth</i>, were widely praised. Mr. Callow, himself a novelist, poet, and biographer, has also written lives of Chekhov, C�zanne, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Walt Whitman, all published to critical acclaim.

The</p><p>In the world of Alice Munro, the best route is not necessarily the shortest distance between two points. In her ninth superlative collection of short fiction, <i>The Love of a Good Woman</i>, the setting is once again western Canada, and the subject matter is classic Munro: secrets, love, betrayal, and the stuff of ordinary lives. But as is usual for this master of the short form, the path she takes is anything but ordinary. The stunning title story is a case in point. A narrative in four parts, it begins with the drowning of a small-town optometrist and ripples outward, touching first the boys who find the body, then a spiteful dying woman and her young practical nurse. Whose tale <i>is</i> this, anyway? Not the optometrist's, surely, though his death holds it together. The effect is not exactly <i>Rashomon</i>-like either, though each of the sections views him through a different eye. Instead, "The Love of a Good Woman" is as thorough and inclusive a portrait of small-town life as can be imagined--its tensions and its deceit, its involuntary bonds. Within its 75 pages it encompasses a world more capacious than that of most novels.<p> As always, Munro's prose is both simple and moving, as when the letter-writing protagonist of "Before the Change" sends her love to an ex-fianc�: </p><blockquote> What if people really did that--sent their love through the mail to get rid of it? What would it be that they sent? A box of chocolates with centers like the yolks of turkey's eggs. A mud doll with hollow eye sockets. A heap of roses slightly more fragrant than rotten. A package wrapped in bloody newspaper that nobody would want to open. </blockquote> The fictions in this volume burn with a kind of dry-eyed anti-romanticism--even the ones whose plots verge on domestic melodrama (a baby's near-death in "My Mother's Dream"; an adulterous wife in "The Children Stay"). Densely populated, elliptical in construction, each story circles around its principal events and relationships like planets around a sun. The result is layered and complex, its patterns not always apparent on first reading: in other words, something like life. <i>--Mary Park</i>Superb...Long ago, Virginia Woolf described George Eliot as one of the few writers 'for grown-up people.'

From the White House to Downing Street, from the fault-line countries of South Asia to the sands of Guant�namo, Suskind offers an astonishing story that connects world leaders to the forces waging today's shadow wars and to the next generation of global citizens. Tracking down truth and hope within the Beltway and far beyond it, Suskind delivers historic disclosures with this emotionally stirring and strikingly original portrait of the post-9/11 world.</p><p>In a sweeping, propulsive, and multilayered narrative, <em>The Way of the World</em> investigates how America relinquished the moral leadership it now desperately needs to fight the real threat of our era: a nuclear weapon in the hands of terrorists. <em>Truth, justice,</em> and <em>accountability</em> become more than mere words in this story. Suskind shows where the most neglected dangers lie in the story of "The Armageddon Test" &#x2014;a desperate gamble to send undercover teams into the world's nuclear black market to frustrate the efforts of terrorists trying to procure weapons-grade uranium. In the end, he finally reveals for the first time the explosive falsehood underlying the Iraq War and the entire Bush presidency.</p><p>While the public and political realms struggle, <em>The Way of the World</em> simultaneously follows an ensemble of characters in America and abroad who are turning fear and frustration into a desperate&#x2014;and often daring&#x2014;brand of human salvation. They include a striving, twenty-four-year-old Pakistani �migr�, a fearless UN refugee commissioner, an Afghan teenager, a Holocaust survivor's son, and Benazir Bhutto, who discovers, days before her death, how she's been abandoned by the United States at her moment of greatest need. They are all testing American values at a time of peril, and discovering solutions&#x2014;human solutions&#x2014;to so much that has gone wrong.</p><p>For anyone hoping to exercise truly informed consent and begin the process of restoring the values and hope&#x2014;along with the moral clarity and earned optimism&#x2014;at the heart of the American tradition, <em>The Way of the World</em> is a must-read.</p></p><p><p><strong>RON SUSKIND</strong> is the author of <em>The Way of the World</em>, <em>The One Percent Doctrine</em>, <em>The Price of Loyalty</em>, and <em>A Hope in the Unseen</em>.

He lives in Washington, D.C.</p><b>Chapter 1</b><br><i><br>Welcome Home<br></i><br>Usman Khosa awakes to the voices of his roommates in the kitchen. A hazy sun is shining in, giving the exposed brick above his bed an orange hue. He checks his night-table clock &#x2013; 7:15 &#x2013; and slips back into the deep sleep of a young man.<br><br>It is morning in America. Or at least in an apartment near Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C., where three young, well-educated men start a summer&#x2019;s day. They are friends, a few years out of Connecticut College, dancing through the anxious glories of first jobs and few obligations. It&#x2019;s a guy&#x2019;s world. Linas, a strapping Catholic, American-born, with Midwestern roots, is an economic analyst; David, Jewish and gay, with wavy brown hair and movie-idol looks, is a public relations staffer for an international aid organization. After breakfast, they slip out together, each in a blazer and khakis, Christian and Jew, straight and gay, into the flow of the capital&#x2019;s professional class.<br><br>Their Muslim roommate hears the front door shut and rises with a sense of well-being. He&#x2019;d worked late, as usual, and then met some friends for dinner, a night that went late with loud talk and drink. He came south to D.C. from Connecticut just over three years ago, a day after receiving his diploma with its summa cum laude seal, to a waiting desk at an international economic consulting firm, Barnes Richardson, with offices across the street from the U.S. Treasury Department and a block from the White House. He finds the work fascinating because it is: taking sides in bloodless struggles between countries and their major corporations over product dumping and tariffs. Trade wars. It&#x2019;s the kind of conflict that smart folks thought the world was moving toward in the mercantile 1990s, when the Soviet Union&#x2019;s fall was to usher in a post-ideological age, a period when aggression would be expressed, say, with tariffs on imported cars and wheat dumping. It was a hopeful notion that issues of progress and grievance, the fortunes of haves and have-nots, would be fought on an economic field where the score could be kept in terms of GDP, per capita income, and infant mortality rates. It wouldn&#x2019;t turn out that way, as the few who saw the rise of religious extremism foretold.<br><br>And that&#x2019;s why the boy brushing his teeth this particular morning &#x2013; July 27, 2006 &#x2013; is not just any young professional on the make. He is, notably, a Muslim from the fault line country of Pakistan &#x2013; the home, at present, of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, Pervez Musharraf and Mullah Omar, fifty-five nuclear weapons and countless angry bands of Islamic radicals. Usman, from this place, of this place, strives with an ardent, white-hot yearning to be accepted into America&#x2019;s current firmament of fading hopes. Like each fresh wave of newcomers, he presses mightily to make that hope new. Whether he means to or not, he&#x2019;s testing American ideals at a time of peril.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a fault of cultural nearsightedness, or worse, that he is not immediately seen as identical to immigrants glorified in oft-told tales of potato famines or Russian pogroms or, back further, a search to worship freely by some <i>Mayflower </i>stowaway. He is, after all, identical to them in every essential way.<br><br>But his journey involves a blue &#x2019;78 Toyota Corolla. In Pakistan, a car is a symbol of a man who can move as he wishes, where he wishes. A new one is a rarity, a luxury, and Usman&#x2019;s father, Tariq, was given the car as a wedding gift from his father, who told Tariq that a married man should have a car, and he should be his &#x201c;own man, beholden to no one.&#x201d;<br><br>The Khosas have a deep history in the region that now lies at the geographical heart of modern-day Pakistan, but the family is not among the few dozen elite who long ruled South Asia and cut deals with the British when the empire took over in the 1860s. The shaping hand of the Brits is still keenly felt in the region, particularly in its cutthroat academic tradition. <i>Competition </i>would be too generous a word. It was more emancipation through recitation, a test of classical British learning with a million contestants, a handful of winners, and enormous prizes, all determined by a crucible known as the civil ser vice exam. In the vast country of India, a fraction of the highest scorers would win coveted acceptance into the civil service &#x2013; the bureaucracy, running their country for the British &#x2013; which came with grants of significant leverage over their countrymen and subtly stolen rewards. Even after India broke free in 1947, the civil service test remained, grandfathered in by the country&#x2019;s ruling elite, who could recall the posting of scores &#x2013; the day, the minute, the sensation &#x2013; like a family&#x2019;s second birth, cited often and judiciously from parent to child across eras.<br><br>Usman&#x2019;s grandfather, a very good student, finished one slot out of the money, so to speak, but carried the fervor of the runner-up into the newly created state of Pakistan. As a young man, he met Muhammad Ali Jinnah and thoroughly internalized the great man&#x2019;s vision of a Muslim state that would break away from Hindu-dominated India; an Islamic republic with mosque-state separations and protections modeled loosely on Western democracies, where religion would be largely a private matter and rigorous education all but deified. Jinnah&#x2019;s idea was that this balance would allow the growth of a professional class that would become the country&#x2019;s cornerstone of progress. Usman&#x2019;s grandfather embodied that vision. He became a lawyer, involved himself in countless public causes, and began to sell what land the family had built up in the past few centuries to educate his children in the finest regard Pakistan had to offer. Usman&#x2019;s father, Tariq, was the eldest and the first beneficiary, taking his college degree and that blue Toyota on an array of edgy professional missions and rising through Pakistan&#x2019;s competitive bureaucracy to become one of the leading law enforcement officials in the country. Like many bureaucrats, he moved between government houses, even had government servants, but acquired little cash, and so the remainder of the family&#x2019;s land was sold to educate <i>his </i>children at Pakistan&#x2019;s best schools. This meant that Usman&#x2019;s sister, two years his senior, starred at Lahore&#x2019;s finest private academy for girls and won a full scholarship to the London School of Economics. And that Usman, a blazing student at Lahore&#x2019;s exclusive Aitchison School &#x2013; built a century before by the British to educate the children of India&#x2019;s feudal families &#x2013; was given a full scholarship to Connecticut College. The problem came down to what wasn&#x2019;t covered: the costly flight from Pakistan to America.<br><br>After twenty-two years of faithful service, the Toyota spoke to Tariq. He&#x2019;d invested an abundance of attitude and nostalgia in the old blue beast, buffed it regularly, scraped out rust; he could feel the distance traveled, for both car and driver, in the sag of the chassis, the glossy bareness of the upholstery. Everyone knew what the car meant to him, and what it meant when he sold it for his only son&#x2019;s plane fare to America.<br><br>That&#x2019;s how the Khosa line &#x2013; Jinnah&#x2019;s line, in a way &#x2013; passed to Connecticut, where Usman studied fiercely, headed the Muslim Students Association, and became a leader in the student government. He met his current roommates as a sophomore presiding over the freshman class&#x2019;s disputed student government election, in which both Linas and David were candidates. They both ended up winning their races, and all three now see this as rich and ironic, that Usman &#x2013; hailing from the due process&#x2014;challenged Pakistan &#x2013; was the Connecticut College election commissioner who handed out victories. They furthermore think it&#x2019;s &#x201c;sitcom-worthy&#x201d; that a Jew, a Christian, and a Muslim are sharing an apartment as the world&#x2019;s us-versus-them divisions seem to be boiling over. They argue, with fierce good nature, over who should do the dishes or whether Usman should introduce Linas to a nice Muslim girl or find a nice Muslim boy for David. No loss of confidence in the cross-border ideal, not here. In fact, this three-bedroom apartment &#x2013; galley kitchen, utilities included &#x2013; is a safe house of sorts, the opposite number to a cell of young religious radicals arguing over the dishes in Wembly or Karachi or Kabul.<br><br>Usman, like immigrants before him, is a walker. It&#x2019;s something about the crowd, its intimacy and anonymity, and the way you can flow inside of it. It draws him in. Any trip of a few miles or less he takes on foot. He keeps business suits and sport jackets in the closet at work, or at the dry cleaners near his office. So each day of summer he slips into shorts, Nikes, and a T-shirt and squeezes his laptop into a backpack.<br><br>It is a warm day, but not nearly as warm as Lahore, he thinks, stepping outside. Oh yes, Lahore is much hotter than this, and dusty. Washington, even at its most humid, feels temperate and superior, lovely and fresh, and seems to wash ancient grit from his pores. He stops on the top stoop, spins his iPod to a play loop of Arabic tunes, and sets forth for Pennsylvania Avenue.<br>&#x201c;Thank you, that&#x2019;s fine for today,&#x201d; George W. Bush says, as he dismisses a half-dozen attendees of his morning intelligence briefing and settles behind the world&#x2019;s most famous desk. He&#x2019;s agitated, doing his best to get things in order before he leaves for his annual August vacation in a week. But the world won&#x2019;t heed his will, not anymore. The Oval Office is quiet &#x2013; an unscheduled half hour &#x2013; and a precious moment to step back, to take stock. His best-laid plans for this summer are already in tatters. It was to be a season to focus on his strengths, with the midterm elections just over three months away. That meant domestic issues, where he has capital with a reasonably strong economy, and events highlighting his one remaining area of strength in the foreign arena: handling terrorists.<br><br>Except everything, and everyone, has been conspiring against him. His poll numbers are in the basement, with several mid-July tallies putting his approval rating at just 40 percent, the lowest for any modern president going into the midterms. Casualties in Iraq have been steadily rising since the spring &#x2013; the country is all but exploding in sectarian violence. Karl Rove and Condi Rice are talking about shifting the rhetoric on Iraq away from the value of America&#x2019;s eventual triumph to the unthinkable dangers that would attend America&#x2019;s withdrawal. He spent yesterday, July 26, with Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Malaki, who gave a speech to Congress that the White House staff worked and reworked until it screamed. The consensus sentiment in the morning&#x2019;s papers is that al-Malaki gave a campaign speech that was completely divorced from reality.<br><br>If people want depressing reality, there&#x2019;s plenty of that to go around. Israel is sinking deeper each day into a disastrous engagement, now two weeks along, with a stronger-than-expected Hezbollah. It&#x2019;s a mess. The morning&#x2019;s reports from the region show the worst day of Israeli losses yet &#x2013; 9 dead &#x2013; and ever worsening PR blowback from two weeks of &#x201c;unintended&#x201d; casualties, now at 489 Lebanese civilians. Meanwhile, only 20 Hezbollah fighters have perished. And, two days ago, 4 United Nations workers died when a clearly marked UN outpost was hit by Israeli bombers. Reports have emerged of the humanitarian workers madly radioing Maydays to the Israeli army in their last moments.<br><br>Bush talked this morning at 7:30 to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, about all this. The unified front on Israel and Hezbollah they both helped craft at the G8 meeting last week in Russia is in tatters. Yesterday Rice was in Rome, where representatives from the United States, Europe, and the Middle East met to try to hammer out a cease-fire. But the terms were untenable, and Bush, talking to Rice, opposed it. He was instantly pilloried for that in last night&#x2019;s news cycles, and all the G8 partners &#x2013; everyone except the Brits &#x2013; are distancing themselves. So when he talked to Merkel, he told her no one is saying that aggression is the first choice, not for the Americans in Iraq or the Israelis in Lebanon. But it must be an option. In his first National Security Council meeting as president he tried to set the tone, telling all the NSC principals his view that &#x201c;sometimes a show of force by one side can really clarify things.&#x201d; Couldn&#x2019;t have been much clearer than that. Said it again this morning to Merkel, and still believed it, more strongly than ever. Merkel at least understood this position. She wasn&#x2019;t like her predecessor, Gerhardt Schroeder, who opposed the United States on Iraq and didn&#x2019;t seem to think force was ever justified. No, Merkel understood. She&#x2019;d said so on the phone &#x2013; their second call this week &#x2013; and that she would make statements in the coming days in support of the United States and Israel. Some things were worth fighting for.<br><br>But what&#x2019;s really driving Bush&#x2019;s calculations at the moment is the just-finished intelligence briefing. It involved a plot that he&#x2019;s been hearing about for some time. The British have been working it since last year: a major terror cell in the suburbs of London. While it&#x2019;s their case &#x2013; they&#x2019;ve made that very clear &#x2013; U.S. involvement has deepened as the tentacles of the cell have spread across Britain to Pakistan. With about forty suspects, sending plenty of e-mails and making calls, the Brits have increasingly had to rely on what Bush likes to call the &#x201c;firepower of Ft. Meade,&#x201d; the massive National Security Agency surveillance complex in the Maryland hills.<br><br>Then, in the past few days, everything changed. Electronic surveillance revealed, finally, the nature of the plot: airliners taking off from Heathrow carrying explosives and headed for the U.S. East Coast. Talk among the suspects revealed it could involve as many as a dozen planes blowing up over U.S. cities. That would make it the biggest plot since 9/11&#x2013; the so-called second wave that Bush and Cheney have been waiting for all these years. Reports of all kinds have been coming to Bush&#x2019;s desk as the U.S. anti-terror machine has secretly ratcheted up. Mike Chertoff, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, is working his intelligence unit around the clock; NSA&#x2019;s working overtime; and CIA is doing what it can, especially with its sources in Pakistan.<br><br>This morning&#x2019;s briefers said that the British are advising the United States to sit back and take a deep breath. The Brits have been stressing that this might be just early logistical talk, that they have these suspects so completely wired that they can&#x2019;t sneeze without generating an electronic dispatch, and that no one is doing anything that would pass for an active operation. Bush has heard this before. Patience, <i>patience</i>. The British are saying that all the time; and that they&#x2019;re better at intelligence work than the United States &#x2013; they&#x2019;ve been doing it longer, they have experience with the IRA&#x2019;s terror network, and they&#x2019;re especially well placed in target communities, such as the Pakistanis and the Saudis. The United States, with all its electronic firepower, is having more and more trouble in recent years with the basic spy craft of recruiting spies and getting actionable information from walk-in informants. The big breaks, of course, have come from sources on the inside or nearby, sources that took time to develop, and from informants in communities close to the action. The United States is too anxious and trigger-happy, the Brits complain, taken to picking up some bit of an overheard conversation and then sweeping up suspects. Blair said in a recent conversation with Bush that this was &#x201c;the error of relying on the capability you have rather than developing the capability you need.&#x201d;<br><br>The Brits, after their experience in Northern Ireland, were starting to belie...</p><h2>The Casino Murder Case: A Philo Vance Mystery (Scribner Crime Classics)</h2><p>Philo Vance, gourmet and amateur detective in 1930s Manhattan, investigates three mysterious poisonings at a fashionable gambling club</p><p></p><h2>Berserker Fury</h2><p>Intelligent, space-faring killing machines whose sole purpose is to destroy all biological life, the Berserkers have developed units that can pass for human-created androids to be used to for an all-out attack on humankind, but the humans are one step ahead.

When he began working with others, miraculous recoveries ensued.<p>Movement for Self-Healing details Schneider's methods of stimulating the natural healing powers of the body, with specific guidelines for improving vision, back problems, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, breathing, and muscular dystrophy.</p></p><p>The author, founder and director of the Center for Self-Healing in San Francisco, states that with determination, hard work, and deep inner knowledge, anyone can overcome "incurable" disease. A Russian-born Israeli, Schneider was blind until age 17, when a companion taught him the unorthodox Bates method of eye exercise, which restored his sight. He became a teacher and massage therapist in Tel Aviv, and emigrated to the United States in 1975.

Rowling&#x2019;s Harry Potter novels&#x2014;the perfect gift for Harry Potter fans!</b><br><br><i>What was the model for The Order of the Phoenix?</i><br> <i>Where do those names come from? </i><br> <i>What is the real-life legend behind Voldemort&#x2019;s Dark Mark?</i><br> <i>Could Snape&#x2019;s potions actually work?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> J.K. Rowling&#x2019;s young heroic wizard, Harry Potter, lives in a world populated by dragons, centaurs, trolls, giants&#x2014;and a three-headed dog named Fluffy&#x2014;among other creatures from ancient myths and legends. Discover the astonishing origins of supernatural beasts, clues to hidden meanings in names, and amazing facts about real-life wizards and magic spells. From Alchemists to Unicorns, Basilisks to Veela, this fascinating compendium brings another dimension to Harry&#x2019;s adventures&#x2014;from <i>The Sorcerer&#x2019;s Stone</i> to <i>The Deathly Hallows</i>.<br>This book was not authorized, prepared, approved, licensed or endorsed by J.K. Rowling, Warner Bros., or any other individual or entity associated with the HARRY POTTER books or movie.</p><p>Anyone who has read the Harry Potter books is aware that author J.K. Rowling infuses her stories with references to mythology, literature, history, and legends. Even if you don't know exactly what a manticore or a griffin is, it's likely that many readers have at least a vague sense of the existence of these creatures in ancient lore. Inspired by Rowling's suggestion to a young fan to "go and look it up," author David Colbert did quite a bit of investigation himself. The result is the fun, entertaining, and enlightening <i>Magical Worlds of Harry Potter</i>.<p> From alchemy to hippogriffs to veela, Colbert explores the fascinating meanings between the lines and buried within the names of characters and places in all the Harry Potter books. Chapter headings include such intriguing questions as "Have Witches Always Flown on Broomsticks?" "Why Would Chocolate Help After Escaping a Dementor?" and "Are Any of the Famous Witches and Wizards Real?" A small purple tab in the margin of the first page of each chapter guides readers looking for specific subjects: Divination, Goblins, McGonogall, Owls, Voldemort, Wands, etc. Curious readers will learn the link between Hagrid's pet dog, Fluffy, and the mythological Greek sentry to Hades, Cerberus. And they'll get a taste of scholar Joseph Campbell's theories on heroism, with Harry as the hero, of course. The true magic of this book is that it will surely inspire Harry Potter fans to delve deeper into the various areas it explores. Readers will soon be clamoring for collections of Greek, Japanese, Indian, and Egyptian mythology, as well as copies of <i>The Sword in the Stone</i>, <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, and <i>Treasure Island</i>, to discover the sources of their favorite Harry Potter books.

Motion, power, energy and momentum are the driving forces of physics, and numbers govern all sports. People and objects move in lines and curves, geometry determines progress, times are recorded, points counted, scores calculated. Without understanding numbers, it is impossible to understand sport. Athletes should be interested in the mathematics of sport for the simple reason that it can help them win. For fans, it brings greater enjoyment from their favorite sport. </p><p> <b><i>All the Right Angles</i></b> is a fun, fascinating and highly visual book that explains the mathematical and scientific principles in sports. With a clear infographics approach, the book never burdens readers with too many numbers and formulas or slows them down with jargon. Instead, dynamic layouts, bold and colorful diagrams and minimal text promote easy comprehension. </p><p> There are four parts with self-contained spreads that cover 89 topics in all. They include:<br> </p><ul> <li> <b>Power and Motion</b>: Basketball and Conservation of Energy; Ball Games and the Magnus Effect; Football and Newtonian Physics of Collision; Squash and Gas Pressure; Cycling and Gyroscopes </li><li> <b>Angles, Trajectories and Geometry</b>: Mathematics of a Golf Shot; Pool and Tangent Lines; Auto Racing and Distance; Baseball and Trajectories; Cycling and Gradients </li><li> <b>Numbers and Statistics</b>: Statistics in Baseball; Mathematics and Fantasy Football; Game Theory and Fencing; The Statistics of Home Advantage </li><li> <b>Mathematics, Biology and Environment</b>: Effects of Tennis Court Surfaces; Horsepower; Skydiving and Terminal Velocity; Fencing, Tennis and Reaction Speeds; Hydration and Performance. </li></ul> <p></p><p> Eight "Sports by Numbers" feature spreads cover baseball, football, rugby, golf, cricket, soccer, tennis and Formula 1. Throughout the book are facts, statistics, trivia and little-known anecdotes that will entertain all sport fans and athletes. </p><p> Sports offer a unique and engaging way into an intimidating topic that many people have written off as "too hard." The games we love have an unrivalled power to turn us on to the beauty of numbers. <b><i>All the Right Angles</i></b> is a highly entertaining introduction to that power for the mathematically-minded, the science buff and the curious reader alike. </p></p><p><p> <b>Joel Levy</b> is a writer, journalist and the author of more than a dozen books on science and history, including <i>A Bee in a Cathedral</i>. He has written features and articles for the British press, and appeared on numerous television and radio shows. Joel has a BSc in Biological Sciences and an MA in Psychology and lives in London, England. </p><p> Introduction </p><p> Did you know that the oldest known soccer ball dates to 1540 C.E., that the British cyclist Bradley Wiggins climbed the equivalent of a 62-mile-high mountain in training for the 2012 Tour de France, or that a pronghorn antelope would finish galloping the 800-meter race while the world record-holding human was only one-third of the way round the running track? </p><p> Did you know that a baseball batter has just over one-fifth of a second to decide whether, how hard and at what angle to hit the ball, and that getting the timing wrong by 7 milliseconds will make the difference between a home run, a pop fly or a strike? </p><p> Did you know that an average man can hold his breath for over 20 min, that badminton is the fastest racket sport in the world and that, statistically speaking, Australian cricket player Donald Bradman's batting average is the single most impressive record in sports? </p><p> Is it all simply fascinating trivia, or do these facts and figures have any greater significance for the world of sports? Sports are all about motion, power, energy and momentum. The people and objects involved move in lines and curves, their progress determined by geometry. Any definition of sports begins with the term "physical," as in "governed by physics." To regulate and score sports, times are recorded, points counted, scores calculated. Every one of these phenomena, processes and events is governed by numbers, from the energy involved in propelling a ball to the calculation of a coefficient that determines tournament seeding. It is not possible to understand sports without numbers, and without understanding it is impossible to improve. </p><p> At elite levels, winning is determined by the tiniest of margins and precise analysis is essential to the incremental improvement of performance. Knowing the numbers can give you the edge. This is increasingly recognized in professional sports, where the introduction of statistical recording and analysis systems, such as Sabermetrics in baseball and Prozone in soccer have made major contributions to athletic success and placed mathematics firmly in the heart of the locker room and the manager's office. Athletes should be interested in the mathematics of sports for this simple reason if nothing else: the application of science can help them win. </p><p> The traffic between sports and mathematics goes both ways, because sport offers a unique and engaging way into mathematics. Everyone, whether they realize it or not, is a sort of 'folk mathematician,' unconsciously relating quantities and magnitudes, angles and vectors. But too many people switch off as soon as the maths in their life becomes explicit, and sport has an unrivalled power to turn them on to the power and beauty of numbers. </p><p> The fascination of numbers, geometry and statistics will hopefully shine through the pages of this book and you will never think the same way about hitting, or watching someone else hitting, a nine iron, swinging at a curveball, winding up for a slap shot or curling in a free kick. </p></p><h2>The Alcoholism &amp; Addiction Cure: Addiction Ends Here</h2><p>The breakthrough three-step program to total recovery from addiction to drugs, alcohol and addictive behaviors. Reveals the four causes of dependency and shows how to create a personalized , holistic treatment program to completely cure your dependency.</p><p><b>Breakthrough 3-Step Program from the World-Renowned Passages Addiction Cure Center</b> <br> <p> <i>The Alcoholism and Addiction Cure</i> contains the three-step holistic program to total recovery that is the basis of the miraculous success of Passages. In this revolutionary book, you will learn:<br> </p><p> </p><ul> <li>The three steps to permanent sobriety</li> <li>The four causes of dependency</li> <li>How to create a personalized, holistic treatment program to completely cure your dependency</li> <li>How your thoughts, emotions, and beliefs are key factors in your recovery</li> <li>How to stimulate your body's self-healing potential to be forever free of dependency </li> </ul> <p> "Freedom from dependency starts with understanding that alcohol, drugs, and addictive behaviors are not the real problems," says Chris Prentiss, cofounder of Passages Addiction Cure Center. "Alcohol, street drugs, nicotine, prescription medications, food bingeing, gambling, and the like are merely the substances or behaviors you or your loved ones are using to cope with the real problems--anything from deep emotional pain, ill health, or depression to hypoglycemia, a sluggish thyroid, or brain-wave pattern imbalances. <i>Once the underlying problems are discovered and cured, the need for drugs, alcohol, or addictive behavior will disappear--along with the craving."</i><br> </p><p> Prentiss should know. His son Pax was addicted to heroin, cocaine, and alcohol for ten years. They sought help everywhere, but Pax relapsed again and again. In desperation, they finally created their own holistic, hand-tailored program that was a complete break from all other programs and that combined several effective therapies. It saved Pax's life. Together, father and son founded Passages Addiction Cure Center to help others find their own freedom.<br></p><p> </p><p>For decades, we've been hearing that alcoholism and addiction are incurable diseases, but <i>The Alcoholism and Addiction Cure</i> proves that this is a dangerous myth and that the label of "alcoholic" or "addict" destroys the promise of full recovery. Today, thousands are being freed from the old, limiting paradigms by using the groundbreaking approach spelled out in this book. A visionary and an innovator, Chris Prentiss brings new hope to people everywhere who are dependent on drugs, alcohol, or addictive behaviors.<br></p><p> </p><p><i>The Alcoholism and Addiction Cure</i> will show you how to end relapse, end your craving, end addictive behavior, and end your suffering.</p>Chris Prentiss is the co-founder and co-director of the Passages Addiction Cure Center in Malibu, California. He is also the author of a dozen books on personal growth and has led personal empowerment workshops in Southern California. He has also written, produced and directed a feature film.</p><h2>The Essential Guide to Dual Sport Motorcycling: Everything You Need to Buy, Ride, and Enjoy the World&#39;s Most Versatile Motor</h2><p>This book is written to help adventuresome motorcyclists buy, ride, and enjoy dual sport motorcycles, those versatile machines that are equally at home on the street and in the dirt. It is organized into four sections covering motorcycle selection, setup, riding technique, and specialized activities such as off-road touring and rallies. Several chapters include exercises designed to improve riding and impart new skills. Over 250 full-color photographs illustrate the many options for gear, clothing, and aftermarket accessories which can add comfort, safety, and convenience to any motorcycle adventure. The book also contains many references and sources to orient enthusiasts to the sometimes overwhelming sea of information that is available. New riders will benefit from the clear explanations of dual sport gear, accessories, and techniques, while experienced riders coming to dual sport from a street riding background will find chapters covering advanced dirt riding skills, GPS navigation, and preparing for multi-day trips. Riders at all levels will gain a broader perspective of the dual sport experience, from which they can begin their journey to new motorcycle adventures.</p><p>Carl Adams has been riding dual sport motorcycles for more than 45 years, including a period of endure racing in the &#39;70s. More recently he has served as an officer of an active dual sport riding club in Reno, Nevada." As roads become more crowded and the speed capabilities of everyday motorcycles approach those of the fastest racing machines, the desire to enjoy the simple pleasures of gathering a group of friends for an off-road adventure gets more appealing all the time.&nbsp; You may know of trails in your area and be aware of events you might enter, but the unknowns could be holding you back.&nbsp; Carl Adams has done us all a great favor by creating an encyclopedic look at dual-sporting; "Everything you need to buy, ride and enjoy the world's most versatile motorcycles" to paraphrase the book's cover.&nbsp; Malcolm Smith wrote the foreword, and you can't ask for a higher recommendation than that.&nbsp; This book contains so many nuggets of wisdom, you'll be at least a year ahead of the game by the last page."&nbsp; - <i><b>Motorcycle Consumer News</b></i><br><br>"Today's dual sport rider faces many bewildering choices for machines and gear. Navigating those waters is tough and trusted advice can help riders make the most of their time and money. (Adams) thrifty no-nonsense perspective is refreshing and sound. . . .I give it four out of four cylinders." - <b><i>Editor Victor Wanchena, Minnesota Motorcycle Monthly</i></b><br></p><h2>God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy</h2><p><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>Publishers Weekly</i> bestseller!</b></p><p>In <i>God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy</i>, Mike Huckabee asks, "Have I been taken to a different planet than the one on which I grew up?" The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author explores today's fractious American culture, where divisions of class, race, politics, religion, gender, age, and other fault lines make polite conversation dicey, if not downright dangerous. As Huckabee notes, the differences of opinion between the "Bubble-villes" of the big power centers and the "Bubba-villes" where most people live are profound, provocative, and sometimes pretty funny. Where else but in Washington, D.C. could two presidential golf outings cost the American taxpayers $2.9 million in travel expenses? </p><p>Government bailouts, politician pig-outs, and popular culture provocations from Jay-Z and Beyonc� to Honey Boo-Boo to the Duck Dynasty's Robertson family. Gun rights, gay marriage, the decline of patriotism, and the mainstream media's contempt for those who cherish a faith-based life. The trouble with Democrats, the even bigger trouble with Republicans, our national security complex, and how our Constitution is eroding under our noses. Stories of everyday Americans surviving tough times, reflections on our way of life as it once was, as it is, and as it might become...these subjects and many more are covered with Mike Huckabee's signature wit, insight, and honesty.</p><p>At times lighthearted, at others bracingly realistic, Huckabee's brand of optimistic patriotism highlights American ideals, offering a bright outlook for future generations. </p><p>With a wry eye for the ridiculous and a clear-eyed look at the most controversial issues of our time, <i>God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy</i> is Mike Huckabee at his very best.</p></p><p>Mike Huckabee is the former governor of Arkansas and a 2016 presidential candidate. He is the author of eleven previous books, including <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers<i> A Simple Christmas</i> and <i>Do the Right Thing</i>. He and his wife, Janet, live in Florida and still spend time in Arkansas. They have three grown children and four grandchildren.&#x201c;Anyone who has enjoyed any of the previous books by Huckabee--former governor, one-time presidential candidate, and Fox News host--will be more than satisfied with this examination of the differences between "Bubbleville" (New York, L.A., and D.C.) and "Bubbaville" (the rest of America)...Huckabee leavens his musings on the state of the union with a sense of humor ("I prefer boots over Birkenstocks. Does that make me weird?") that makes him enjoyable to read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p>
